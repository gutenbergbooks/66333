<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<hr class="r10" />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> geologists imagine that the order of creation
is registered in the rocks which compose the external
crust of the earth, and that they can there clearly read
a progressive development of organic life; in other
words, that a succession of more perfect animals may
be traced in ascending from the lower strata to the
upper or more recent formations; that there is a gradual
approach to the present system of things, and a
succession of destructions and creations; worlds of
living beings alternating with worlds of desolation
and death, antecedent to the existence of man.</p>

<p>Others, again, contend that there is often a wide
and palpable discrepancy between the nature of the
rock, and the fossils which it contains, and, therefore,
that such inquiries afford no clue, whatever, to the
order of creation.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> We propose not to enter the field
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">- 6 -</span>
of controversy. Fossils are undoubtedly historic medallions
of remote periods in the natural history of
our earth, and our design is, merely to illustrate with
them a neglected department of ancient zoology, by
describing a few which have recently fallen under our
own observation.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> Nothing can be more opposed to true science, than to
pronounce on the priority of formation, or the comparative age of
rocks, from either their structure, or the organic remains they
present. M. Alexandre Brongniart thus propounds his opinion:
"In those cases where characters derived from the nature of the
rocks are opposed to those which we derive from organic remains,
I should give the preponderance to the latter." This
seems to us to imply an admission, that nothing definite can be
inferred from the <i>nature of the rocks</i>; moreover, that between
the nature of the rock, and the organic remains, there may be a
palpable discrepancy; and that these may be even at complete
antipodes with each other. The event has proved, from what we
have already mentioned, that no evidence as to priority can be
obtained from the nature of the fossil remains displayed in particular
strata. In addition to what has been said on this subject,
we may further state, that <i>encrinites</i>, <i>entrochites</i>, and <i>pentacrinites</i>
are found in clay slate, grauwacke, transition limestone, alpine
limestone, lias, muschelkalk, and chalk. It may be reasonably
asked how these three species of fossils could indicate any
particular formation, when they are found in so many types and
structures of rocks altogether different? If they would go to
prove any thing at all, it would be that of a <i>contemporaneous</i> formation;
but certainly not distinct epochas. <i>See Eclectic Review,
July, 1832.</i></p>

</div>

<p>In some varieties of rocks there is often found the
fossil remains of an animal which bears some resemblance
to certain species of the crab. The back of
this organic relic is commonly divided by two deep
grooves or furrows, into three longitudinal lobes, and
from this circumstance, the term <i>Trilobite</i> has been
applied as a family name to distinguish this whole
race of beings. This general appellation, however,
though in most of the species, highly appropriate, is
by no means applicable to all.</p>

<p>The individuals which compose the family of the
trilobites resemble each other in many important particulars,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">- 7 -</span>
and form together an exceedingly natural
group. The body, with but few exceptions, is divided
transversely into three parts. The anterior
portion or head often resembles the buckler of the
<i>horse foot</i> or <i>king crab</i> (<i>limulus polyphemus</i>), so common
on our sea coast. The middle portion is the <i>abdomen</i>,
and is always separated transversely into a number
of segments or articulations, generally diminishing
in breadth as they recede from the head. The
posterior end is the <i>tail</i>, which, though in some species,
a mere prolongation of the abdomen, that can
scarcely be distinguished from it, yet in others it assumes
a genuine caudal appendage.</p>

<p>The head of the trilobite is also generally divided
into three parts: the middle is called the <i>front</i>, or forehead;
and the lateral portions the <i>cheeks</i>. In most
cases, a projecting tubercle, or knob, is observable on
the anterior surface of each cheek, which has much
the appearance of an eye. Its reticulated structure
is in many instances so analogous to that of the eyes
of some crustaceous animals, and also of some species
of insects, that there can be but little doubt that
these tubercular projections, were true organs of vision.</p>

<p>Some of the genera which belong to this remarkable
race of fossil animals, possessed the power of
rolling or coiling themselves up into a kind of ball,
like certain species of insects, or like the armadillo;
and they are always found embedded in the rocks in
this attitude.</p>

<p>Such are the general characters by which these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">- 8 -</span>
petrifactions may be known, and they will be found
illustrated in a manner more or less striking, in most
of the species. The exceptions, which rarely occur,
will be distinctly marked, when the species are
described.</p>

<p>The superior covering, or upper shell of the trilobite
is the only part of the animal, concerning which
we have any satisfactory knowledge. It is conjectured
that it was furnished with articulated feet, but
no traces of any organs of progressive motion have
hitherto been fairly discovered.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Hence, it may be
reasonably supposed, that the structure of the lower
portions of the animal were so soft and delicate, as to
render them incapable of sustaining the process of
mineralization, which the hard crustaceous covering
of the back so successfully undergoes.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> Mr. Parkinson states, that in a trilobite which he possessed he
thought he perceived the <i>points</i> of the feet; but on endeavouring
to detach the piece of rock in which it was embedded, the specimen
was entirely shivered, though he worked at it with the utmost
care. A portion of the underside of a trilobite (<i>Isotelus
gigas</i>) near the anterior edge of the head, was distinctly ascertained,
by Dr. Dekay, but only enough to convince him of its
analogy in this part with that of the limulus polyphemus no organs
of locomotion could be seen. Mr. Stokes, the distinguished
fossilist of London, has confirmed the observation of Dr. Dekay,
by some dissections of his own.</p>

</div>

<p>That these petrifactions were once marine animals
there can be little doubt, for they are always found
associated in the same rocks with shells, and other
productions peculiar to the sea.</p>

<p>The Trilobite is supposed by many naturalists to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">- 9 -</span>
be one of the first animated beings of our earth called
into existence by the great Author of nature.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> It
was first noticed more than two centuries ago, among
the petrifactions which abound in a calcareous rock,
at Dudley, in England, and was from this circumstance,
called for a long time, the <i>Dudley fossil</i>.
Linn&eacute; gave it the name of the <i>Paradoxical insect</i>; but
whether an insect, a crustaceous animal, or a shell, is
still considered by many as problematical.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a> It is obvious, that if most of the gelatinous animals which
now inhabit our seas, were to become extinct, few or no traces
of them could be found in any succeeding depositions of earthy
matter. Whatever kind of animal life, therefore, may have been
the first which appeared in our planet, must be entirely hypothetical.
All that we can with certainty say of it, is, that it was
best adapted to the circumstances, in which it was to exist, and
that it was consistent with the wisdom and design which we
see every where pervading the universe.</p>

</div>

<p>Notwithstanding the high antiquity of the family
of the Trilobites, and the remarkable characters the
different individuals which compose it, sustain in the
animal kingdom; till within a very few years, the
whole race has been almost entirely neglected by
naturalists. The first attempt at any systematic arrangement
of the genera and species, was made in
1815, by Alexander Brongniart, Professor of Mineralogy,
&amp;c. &amp;c., in Paris.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Until that period, the term<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">- 10 -</span>
<i>Entomolithus Paradoxus</i>, proposed by Linn&eacute;, was applied
to all the fossil remains, which in their general
appearance bore any resemblance to that found at
Dudley, and which he first described under that
name. The confusion, therefore, which existed in
this department of natural science, may readily be
imagined; especially, as the species rapidly multiplied,
when they were supposed to throw some rays
of light on certain obscure geological phenomena.
Soon after the appearance of Professor Brongniart's
excellent work, the attention of other naturalists was
directed to this neglected part of creation. The
most important memoir, on account of the number of
species, well figured and described in it, is one by
Dr. E. W. Dalmann, published in the Transactions of
the Swedish Academy, for 1826. There is also in
the Acts of the Royal Society, at Upsal, an excellent
paper on this subject by Professor Wahlenberg.
Our highly esteemed friend, Dr. James E. Dekay,
has also given in the first volume of the Annals of
the Lyceum of Natural History of New York, some
very interesting and ingenious observations on the
nature and the structure of the Trilobites, with a description
of a new genus. These are the principal
authorities which have been consulted in arranging
the present work.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[4]</a> I cannot let this opportunity pass, without acknowledging
my obligations to Professor Brongniart, for his civilities, when
on a late visit to Paris. Every one whose curiosity leads him
to examine the royal manufactory of porcelain, at Sevres, of
which he is the director, will no doubt acknowledge that his
talents as a philosopher, are rivalled by his accomplishments as
a gentleman.</p>

</div>

<p>Our object in the present undertaking being merely
to give a monograph of the species of Trilobites
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">- 11 -</span>
found in the rocks of North America; we leave to
other and abler hands the more difficult and interesting
task of determining with precision the connexion
which may exist between these organic reliques,
and the relative ages of the strata in which they are
found.</p>

<p>It is supposed, indeed, that a sufficient number of
well characterized species have not yet been collected
and accurately described, to throw any certain and
clear light on otherwise doubtful geological phenomena.
What has been remarked by De Candolle,
with regard to botanical geography, is perhaps true
of these fossils as to solving the difficult problems of
geology&mdash;"Let us not forget," says he, "that this
science can only be commenced when the study of
<i>species</i> has been sufficiently advanced to furnish us
with numerous and well authenticated facts."</p>

<p>We are well aware of the difficulty of settling the
line which ought to divide species. Individuals perfectly
identical in all their parts, are rarely, if ever
seen; though a general resemblance may be easily
traced. Among fossils, just discriminations of this
kind are more delicate, than in recent specimens.
The hand of time, accidental causes, and the influence
of atmospheric changes often produce such
characters as to render the determination of fossil
species an exceedingly difficult task. We have no
doubt, therefore, that a few of our Trilobites, which
are now considered as perfectly identical with some
found in Europe, will upon fuller examination, be
discovered to be dissimilar, and of course certain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">- 12 -</span>
geological speculations grounded on the first opinion,
be ultimately abandoned.</p>

<p>The geographical distribution of organic remains,
is an exceedingly curious inquiry. If accurately pursued,
without reference to any preconceived theory,
it will no doubt furnish much information as to the
comparative ages of the different strata which compose
the external crust of our planet&mdash;for that
these strata were deposited or formed at periods of
time more or less remote from each other, every one
knows, to be a generally admitted <i>geological fact</i>.
The occurrence of similar fossils in districts of country
remotely situated from each other, certainly presents
a phenomenon highly interesting to the speculative
naturalist, and apparently indicates that the
same powerful and general causes must have concurred
to produce these isomorphous depositions.
No fossils have contributed more to this kind of information,
than those of shells, and as the mineralized
species could not be satisfactorily studied, except by
accurately comparing them with those which now
inhabit our seas and continents; the search for shells,
has become, from a simple amusement, the study of
scientific men&mdash;or, as a writer remarks, "it was only
after the period when it was perceived that geology
and ancient zoology were destined to be enlightened
by their fossil remains, that this research passed from
the hands of amateurs into those of naturalists."<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">[5]</a> We have not unfrequently noticed, both in the writings and
conversation of some geologists, a disposition to sneer at the
subsidiary branches of natural history. Mineralogy and conchology,
are light and mean in their estimation, when compared
with the study of extensive strata and ponderous boulders. Like
Irving's testy governor of Manahatta, who settled the accounts of
his clients by placing their books in the opposite scales of a balance,
they decide on the value of a science, by the absolute
weight of the objects embraced by it. Geology, as well as any
other branch of natural history, may degenerate into a mere love
for the curious, or have for its principal aim, the perfection or
improvement of some ideal system of classification, without advancing
a single step further.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">- 13 -</span></p>

<p>Another curious <i>geological fact</i> appears to be established
more especially by fossil trilobites; it is that
precisely the same species of animal relic, is the
most generally diffused over the globe, in proportion
to the antiquity of the rock which contains it. Thus
the transition limestone of England, France, Germany
and Sweden, contains the species called the
Calymene of Blumenbach, in common with the same
formation which extends over so large a portion of
the United States.</p>

<p>Different genera and species of the trilobite are
now found in almost every part of the globe, and are
frequently exceedingly abundant in the rocks which
contain them. That they must have swarmed in
particular places, is abundantly evident from a number
of localities in our own country,&mdash;millions, for
example, must have lived and died not far from
Trenton falls, in the State of New York. There are
very few of the numerous visiters to that romantic
cascade, whose curiosity is not awaked, by the multitude
of these petrified beings, seemingly of another
world, which are there entombed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">- 14 -</span></p>

<p>Although many parts of the trilobite are now found
distributed through the rocks which contain them,
in such a manner as to lead to the conclusion, that
they were separated by decomposition, after the
death of the animal; yet the perfect preservation of
others, and the rolled and disjointed attitudes which
we should expect such creatures to assume when
disturbed, lead to the conjecture, that they have been
often suddenly destroyed, and as suddenly enveloped
in that earthy matter, which afterwards became an
indurated rock; thus preventing the separation of
the harder parts, by the slow process of decomposition.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>The fossil remains of the trilobite family, are supposed
by most naturalists to belong to a race of beings
now extinct; but from the strong analogy which exists
between them and certain species of crustaceous
animals now living, it is highly probable that they
will yet be found alive. This opinion will not be
regarded as visionary, when it is recollected how
large a portion of the surface of the earth is still unexplored
by its enlightened and civilized inhabitants&mdash;how
small the number of animated beings are yet
known to the scientific world&mdash;and above all the fact,
that many animals as confidently declared to be peculiar
to a former world, are now found to be among
the creatures at present in existence. This opinion,
we think, is quite as plausible, and far more interesting,
than the blank and unsatisfactory hypothesis that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">- 15 -</span>
all the trilobites are confined to an order of things
before the present glorious creation.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="label">[7]</a> The incorrectness of the inference that all the genera and
species of fossil animals found in the transition rocks must be
now extinct, will appear from the following extract from Bakewell's
Geology:&mdash;"The <i>Madrepora stylina</i>, so common in transition
lime-stone rock, is entirely wanting in the secondary and
tertiary strata, but a living animal of this species has been recently
discovered in the South Seas. The Pentacrinus makes its first
distinct appearance in the lias; but is not frequently met with
in the upper strata, and disappears entirely in the uppermost formations:
hence it was long supposed that the species was extinct.
A living Pentacrinus has recently been discovered in the
West Indies, and its stem and branches in a perfect state have
been sent to this country." (England.) In the Museum at Albany,
N. Y., I have examined a recent Pentacrinus, which I conclude,
came from the West Indies, from the proprietor's account
of the manner in which he obtained it. It has been a very
perfect specimen but the branches are gradually dropping off.</p>

</div>

<p>There appears to have been known to naturalists,
when the improved edition of Prof. Brongniart's work
on the trilobites appeared in 1822, but 17 well marked
species, and out of which he constructed the five
following genera, which he thus characterizes.</p>


<h3><i>Genus First.</i> <span class="smcap">Calymene.</span></h3>

<p><i>Body</i> capable of contraction into nearly a semicylindrical
sphere.</p>

<p><i>Buckler</i> with many tubercles or folds. Two reticulated
eye-shaped tubercles.</p>

<p><i>Abdomen and Post-abdomen</i> with entire edges. Abdomen
divided by 12 or 14 articulations.</p>

<p>No elongated tail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">- 16 -</span></p>


<h3><i>Genus Second.</i> <span class="smcap">Asaphus.</span></h3>

<p><i>Body</i> broad and rather flat. Middle lobe prominent
and very distinct.</p>

<p><i>Flanks or lateral lobes</i> each double the size of the
middle lobe.</p>

<p><i>Submembranaceous expansions</i> extending beyond the
lateral lobes.</p>

<p><i>Buckler</i> semicircular, with two reticulated eye-shaped
tubercles.</p>

<p><i>Abdomen</i> divided into 8 or 12 articulations.</p>


<h3><i>Genus Third.</i> <span class="smcap">Ogygia.</span></h3>

<p><i>Body</i> much depressed into an oblong ellipsis not
contractile into a sphere.</p>

<p><i>Buckler</i> edged, a slight longitudinal furrow arising
from its anterior extremity. Posterior angles
elongated into points.</p>

<p><i>Without any tubercles</i> except the eyes, which are
neither prominent nor reticulated.</p>

<p><i>Longitudinal lobes</i> slightly prominent.</p>

<p><i>Abdomen</i> with 8 articulations.</p>


<h3><i>Genus Fourth.</i> <span class="smcap">Paradoxides.</span></h3>

<p><i>Body</i> depressed not contractile.</p>

<p><i>Flanks</i> much broader than the middle lobe.</p>

<p><i>Buckler</i> nearly semicircular three transverse furrows
on the middle lobe.</p>

<p><i>Eye-shaped tubercles</i> none.</p>

<p><i>Abdomen</i> with 12 articulations.</p>

<p><i>Arches</i> of the lateral lobes, more or less prolonged
beyond the membrane which sustains them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">- 17 -</span></p>


<h3><i>Genus Fifth.</i> <span class="smcap">Agnostus.</span></h3>

<p><i>Body</i> ellipsoidal&mdash;semicylindrical.</p>

<p><i>Buckler and flanks</i> edged&mdash;the edges being slightly
elevated.</p>

<p><i>Middle lobe</i> with two transverse divisions, each composed
of a single piece.</p>

<p><i>Two glandular</i> tubercles on the anterior part of the
body.</p>

<p>In 1824, Dr. J. E. Dekay added a sixth genus to
the family of the trilobites, which he describes in the
following manner.</p>


<h3><i>Genus Sixth.</i> <span class="smcap">Isotelus.</span></h3>

<p><i>Body</i> oval oblong, often contracted, not unfrequently
extended.</p>

<p><i>Head</i> or <i>buckler</i> large and rounded, equalling the
tail in size, with but two oculiform tubercles.</p>

<p><i>Abdomen</i> with 8 articulations.</p>

<p>Frontal process beneath, with two semilunar terminations.</p>

<p><i>Post-abdomen</i> or <i>tail</i> broad, expanded with indistinct
divisions, as large as the buckler.</p>

<p><i>Longitudinal</i> lobes very distinct.</p>

<p>This genus, he remarks, will be sufficiently distinguished
from the five genera proposed by <i>M. Alexandre
Brongniart</i> in his valuable and truly philosophical
work on the trilobites by the following particulars.</p>

<p>From <i>Calymene</i>. By the presence of but two tubercles
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">- 18 -</span>
on the buckler not reticulated; by the abdomen
with but 8 articulations.</p>

<p>From <i>Asaphus</i>. By the middle lobe, which is double
the size of the lateral ones; by the absence of a membranaceous
expansion on the sides; by the non-reticulation
of the eyes, &amp;c.</p>

<p>From <i>Ogygia</i>. By the rolled form, the rounded
posterior angles of the buckler, and the distinct articulation
of the longitudinal lobes.</p>

<p>From <i>Paradoxide</i> and <i>Agnoste</i> by characters too
obvious to be enumerated. (See Annals of N. York
Lyceum, Sec. Vol. I. pp. 174-5.)</p>

<p>In 1826, J. W. Dalman published in the Transactions
of the Swedish Academy, and also in a separate
work, an account of the trilobites found in the North
of Europe, in which he has enriched the family by a
number of fine species, and with the following genera,
which he modestly proposes merely as subdivisions.</p>


<h3><i>Genus Seventh.</i> <span class="smcap">Nileus.</span></h3>

<p><i>Body</i> short, capable of contraction into a sphere,
smooth, convex.</p>

<p><i>Abdomen</i> with about 8 articulations, without any
dorsal longitudinal furrows.</p>

<p><i>Buckler</i> sub-lunate, with large lateral eyes.</p>

<p><i>Tail</i> expanded, not so large as the buckler, without
lobes.</p>


<p><i>Genus Eighth.</i> <span class="smcap">Ill&aelig;nus.</span></p>

<p><i>Body</i> ovate oblong, contractile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">- 19 -</span></p>

<p><i>Head</i> rounded in front, eyes small, in the temples,
very remote.</p>

<p><i>Abdomen</i> with from 9 to 10 articulations, trilobate.</p>

<p><i>Tail</i> expanded as large as the head.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="label">[8]</a> Some of the species described by Professor Dalman as included
in this genus, we think ought to be referred to that of the
Isotelus.</p>

</div>


<h3><i>Genus Ninth.</i> <span class="smcap">Ampyx.</span></h3>

<p><i>Body</i> very short, contractile.</p>

<p><i>Buckler</i> large, triangular, gibbous; eyes not remarkable.</p>

<p><i>Abdomen</i> short, articulations few (6?), trilobate.</p>

<p><i>Tail</i> expanded, not so large as the head.</p>

<p>Professor Dalman has two other genera, which he
calls Olenus and Battus, the first is the Paradoxides,
and the second the Agnostus of Brongniart.</p>

<p>In the 8th Volume of Annales des Sciences Naturelles
there is a highly valuable paper "Sur les Trilobites
et leurs gisemens," by the Count Rasoumowsky,
in which he describes some new trilobites from
Russia; the one which he has figured and described
as a Calymene<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> from Tzarsko-Selo, undoubtedly belongs
to a new genus, very near to the Isotelus. The
middle lobe is visible or naked through its whole extent,
and the lateral lobes near the tail are covered
with a thick cuticular membrane. This genus we
propose to call Hemicrupturus, and may be thus characterized.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="label">[9]</a> The editors of the Annales remark that this is not a
Calymene, but that it appears to belong to the genus Asaphus.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">- 20 -</span></p>


<h3><i>Genus Tenth.</i> <span class="smcap">Hemicrupturus.</span><a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>&mdash;<i>Green.</i></h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_10" href="#FNanchor_10" class="label">[10]</a> From three Greek words which signify <i>half-concealed tail</i>.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Body</i> contractile.</p>

<p><i>Buckler</i> oculiferous and not lobate.</p>

<p><i>Abdomen</i> trilobate, with 8 articulations.</p>

<p><i>Tail</i>, costal arches covered, middle lobe naked.</p>

<p>The Asaphus expansus of Dalman, and several
other known species may be arranged under this
genus.</p>

<p>As Count Rasoumowsky has given no specific appellation
to the fossil above alluded to, we propose to
call it after his own name, <i>Hemicrupturus Rasoumowskii</i>.
We examined the fine specimen from which
our cast is taken in the cabinet of the Baltimore College,
and for this favour we are indebted to the kindness
of Dr. J. J. Cohen, one of the Professors in that
rising institution.</p>

<p>The following list includes <i>all</i> the genera and species
of the Trilobite Family, hitherto described as
far as known to the author. It is taken from De
La Beche's Manual of Geology.</p>

<p>From the short descriptions given by Professor
Rafinesque of the five last mentioned fossils, I conclude
that they belong to the genus Calymene of
Brongniart.</p>

<p>The study of the trilobites naturally leads to the
consideration of those beings which appear to have
inhabited our earth previous to the creation of man.
Every one knows that the sceptical naturalist has
drawn from these vestiges of organic life, an argument
contradictory to the Mosaic account of the history
of the world, and though every cavil of the least
importance, urged against the truth of the sacred
historian, has been triumphantly confuted, still, the
geological sciolist boldly impugns his veracity, whenever
any new facts in his science can be distorted to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">- 23 -</span>
his purpose. Such being the case, we cannot conclude
this preface without briefly stating two or
three methods by which any seeming discrepancies
may be explained. First, those who imagine that
the six periods of creation, mentioned in the beginning
of the pentateuch, mean literally days of 24
hours each, believe that, as only a small part of the
earth was at first required for the abode of man and
the higher animals, the present continents might
have remained as long beneath the waters, and have
undergone every change necessary to solve this geological
puzzle.</p>

<p>Again, others have thought that Moses, after recording,
in the first sentence of Genesis, the great
truth that all things were made by the will of an intelligent
Creator&mdash;passed silently over some intermediate
state of the earth, which had no direct relation
to the history, or to the duties of man&mdash;and proceeded
to describe the successive appearance of the present
order of things. On this supposition, the fossil
remains and peculiarities in the structure of the
earth may have belonged to that intermediate state.</p>

<p>A third method of explaining the difficulty, and
which we think highly satisfactory, is, by understanding
the days of creation to mean, not ordinary
days, but <i>periods of time</i>, in which the recorded events
took place in the order described so briefly by the
sacred historian. It is acknowledged by every one
competent to judge, that among the Hebrews, <i>days</i>
and <i>weeks</i> were often used in this manner. The accordance
between the order in which, according to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">- 24 -</span>
the account of Moses, the work of creation was accomplished,
and the order in which the fossil remains
of plants and animals are deposited in the
earth, has surprised, and has been acknowledged by
learned sceptics themselves.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11" class="label">[11]</a> The Baron Cuvier, on this subject, remarks, respecting the
Jewish legislator&mdash;"His books show us, that he had very perfect
ideas respecting several of the highest questions of natural philosophy.
His cosmogony, especially, considered purely in a scientific
point of view, is extremely remarkable, inasmuch as the
order which it assigns to the different epochs of creation, is precisely
the same as that which has been deduced from geological
considerations."</p>

</div>

<p>It will be useless to push these arguments further.
The catastrophes which have produced the secondary
strata, and the diluvian depositions, could not
have been local or partial phenomena; but rather
than call upon a comet, with the abstracted philosopher,
to deluge the earth for every new geological
epoch&mdash;or to change the axis of motion of our planet&mdash;or
to resort to any of his wild, fanciful, and impious
theories, we should, with Sir Humphrey Davy, even
prefer the dream that all the secondary strata were
<i>created</i>, filled with the remains, as it were, of animal
life, to confound the speculations of our geological
reasoners.</p>

<p>Every author who attempts a Monograph of any
of the departments of Natural History, must necessarily
depend, in a greater or less degree, upon the
kindness and liberality of others. Rare and unique
specimens, particularly of fossil species, are often
scattered through different cabinets, and his work
would be rendered very imperfect, if they were not
intrusted to his care. In preparing the following
Monograph on the plan of giving exact models of
the species, instead of illustrating them by engravings
in the usual manner, the specimens when used
by the artist are perhaps more liable to accident, and
it was at first supposed that this circumstance might
have prevented the original design. But in no instance,
where an application has been made, either to
a public institution or to a private cabinet, has the author
met with a refusal; indeed the courtesy, kindness,
and liberality which he has experienced from
naturalists, who have every where aided him in the
prosecution of his work, form no inconsiderable
portion of the gratification which he has received.
Besides the acknowledgments to public museums,
and to individuals, which are made in the body of
the work, the author is desirous of recording in this

<h3><span class="smcap">Genus Calymene</span>. <i>Brongniart</i>.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> name of this genus is derived from a Greek
word which signifies <i>obscure</i> or <i>concealed</i>. The fossil
animals included by it are characterized as having
contractile bodies; the buckler as bearing many tubercles
or folds&mdash;the cheeks as being oculiferous,
and the abdomen and tail as being composed of from
twelve to fourteen articulations or joints, without
any membranaceous expansion. The Calymenes in
thickness are nearly semicylindrical, and the buckler
in front presents a <i>chaperon</i> or upper lip more or
Jess raised. In perfect specimens, there is a small
furrow which seems to indicate a separation between
the upper and under parts of this kind of lip. The
eyes are always raised, and frequently present the
remarkable structure observable in many of the <i>crustacea</i>;
but as this part is generally very prominent, the
<i>reticulations</i> of the eye are commonly worn off or injured.</p>

<p>Professor Brongniart places but little confidence
in any of the generic characters above enumerated,
except the number of articulations of the abdomen:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">- 28 -</span>
these, however, in our opinion, are more vague and
uncertain than most of the others. The genus, however,
we think may be readily identified, after becoming
familiar with one well characterized species.
The general aspect of the buckler is peculiar&mdash;the
body is not so depressed as in most other genera, and
the lateral lobes are destitute of all membranaceous
expansion.</p>

<p>To the genus Calymene, belongs the celebrated
Dudley fossil, called <i>Entomolithus paradoxus</i> by Blumenbach,
but which is not the same organic relic,
to which Linn&eacute; applied that name.</p>

<p>This genus includes a great number of species, and
though some of them are said to be found in different
and distant parts of the globe, they are according to
our limited observation, for the most part confined,
like recent species of animals, to particular districts.
The C. polytoma, C. pulchella, C. bellatula, C. concinna,
C. sclerops, and the C. punctata, all finely
figured by Professor Dalman, and which are found
in Sweden, have not yet been noticed in any part of
North America.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_12" href="#FNanchor_12" class="label">[12]</a> See the valuable and extensive communication of J. W.
Dalman, M. D., on the Trilobites, in the Transactions of the
Swedish Academy for 1820, part 2d.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Calymene Blumenbachii.</span> <i>Brongniart.</i> Cast No. 1.</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Clypeo rotundato, tuberculis sex distinctis in
fronte; oculis in genis emintissimis; corpore tuberculato.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">- 29 -</span></p>

<p>In this species the upper lip presents a furrow parallel
to its edges. The lip is straight. The cheeks are
a little projecting. There are six rounded tubercles
on the front, and fourteen articulations on the back;
the tail is small, and the shell is covered with small
rounded tubercles of unequal sizes.</p>

<p>The above is Professor Brongniart's description of
this trilobite, which is the famous Dudley fossil described
and figured by Littleton, in the Philosophical
Transactions, (London) in 1750. According to Dalman,
several distinct European species have been
published under this name. The true C. Blumenbachii,
he says, has thirteen articulations to the abdomen,
and about eight to the tail. In the cabinet of
G. W. Featherstonhaugh, Esq., we have examined a
fine perfect specimen from Dudley,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> in which there
is fourteen abdominal joints. There can be no doubt,
however, that several species have been confounded
under the name of C. Blumenbachii; Dalman's C.
Tuberculata and C. Pulchella are, we think, distinct
from it, though he has marked them only as varieties.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_13" href="#FNanchor_13" class="label">[13]</a> This famous trilobite, once formed a part of the cabinet of
Mr. Parkinson, the distinguished author of the "Organic Remains,"
and is accurately figured on one of the plates of that
splendid work. At the sale of the late Mr. Parkinson's fossils,
it was purchased by Mr. Featherstonhaugh,</p>

</div>

<p>The true C. Blumenbachii, no doubt, abounds in
North America, and is one of the few examples of the
occurrence of an identical species on both continents.
The late Abbe Correa sent a perfect specimen to
Brongniart, from the vicinity of Lebanon, in the state
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">- 30 -</span>
of Ohio. We have also seen a number of specimens
from that state, which could not be distinguished
from the Dudley trilobite. Our model was taken
from a specimen found at Trenton Falls, in the state
of New York.</p>

<p>The three following species found in the United
States, will no doubt be considered by many as mere
varieties of the C. Blumenbachii; we have ventured,
however, to call them by distinct names.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Calymene Callicephala.</span><a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> <i>Green.</i> Cast No. 2.</h4>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_14" href="#FNanchor_14" class="label">[14]</a> From two Greek words, which signify "beautiful head."</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Clypeo antice attenuato, figura liliiformi in fronte
depicta; oculis minimis; abdomine quatuordecim articulis;
corpore plano.</p>
</div>

<p>The buckler is subtriangular; on the front there is
a figure in high relief, somewhat resembling a <i>fleur
de lis</i>; or perhaps more, the capital of a Corinthian
column. The oculiferous tubercles are rather lower
down on the cheeks than usual. The articulations
of the abdomen and the tail cannot well be distinguished
from each, other; fourteen in all may be
easily counted. The middle lobe of the abdomen is
nearly equal in breadth throughout. The ribs, or
costal arches, are not grooved or bifurcated at their
extremities. Length nearly two inches and a half.</p>

<p>This beautiful species is in the Philadelphia Museum,
where it is labelled as being found in "Hampshire,
Virginia." It is mineralized by a dark yellowish
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">- 31 -</span>
limestone. It differs from the C. Blumenbachii,
in the form and number of its articulations; in the
shape of the head; in having only two flat tuberculous
elevations on the front; and in other particulars.</p>

<p>In the cabinet of the New York Lyceum, and in
that of J. P. Wetherill, Esq. there are some examples
of this species from the Miami river, near Cincinnati,
Ohio. I have also seen it from Indiana, in a dark
coloured limestone, very much distorted. It has
never been found at Trenton falls, or at any other locality,
as far as my knowledge extends, which yields
the true C. Blumenbachii.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Calymene Selenecephala.</span><a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> <i>Green.</i> Cast No. 3.</h4>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_15" href="#FNanchor_15" class="label">[15]</a> From the Greek for "lunate head."</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Clypeo antice rotundato, margine omni valde incrassato;
prominentia frontali utrinque trituberosa;
corpore tuberculato.</p>
</div>

<p>The buckler is regularly lunate; the margin is
slightly reflected or raised anteriorly, the posterior
edge forms a continuous rim, running nearly parallel
with the articulations of the abdomen. The front on
each side has one large and two small tubercles, near
its superior edge. The oculiferous tubercles on the
cheeks are on a line with the lowest frontal tubercle.
There are fourteen distinct articulations; but as the
tail is mutilated and distorted, the total number of
joints cannot, from this specimen, be ascertained.
The body appears to have been covered with small
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">- 32 -</span>
pustules. These are very evident on the front. Costal
arches simple, or not grooved. Length, one inch
and three-fourths, breadth of the buckler one inch
and one-fourth.</p>

<p>This species resembles a little the C. Pulchella of
Dalman. The specimen from which the model was
taken, is in the possession of Mr. R. Peale, of New
York, who willingly lent it for this monograph. He
informed me that it was found in the state of New
York, but he was unable to name its precise locality.
It occurs in a soft ash coloured limestone. No other
petrifaction is observable in the fragment of rock
which contains it.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Calymene Platys.</span><a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> <i>Green.</i> Casts No. 4 and 5.</h4>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_16" href="#FNanchor_16" class="label">[16]</a> From a Greek word which signifies Flat,</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Clypeo antice rotundato; prominentia frontali
utrinque quatuor tuberculis.</p>
</div>

<p>The buckler is probably semilunate; but as the anterior
portion is lost, this cannot be determined with
precision. The posterior raised rim is not continuous,
as in the C. Selenecephala, but is separated by
the longitudinal dorsal furrows. The front is distinctly
divided from the cheeks, and has four tubercular
prominences on each side. Three of them are nearly
on a line with the lateral edge of the cheeks, and
gradually diminish in size, as they descend to the
anterior part of the buckler. The other is smaller,
and is between, and a little to the side, of the upper
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">- 33 -</span>
two. The cheeks form spherical triangles. The oculiferous
prominences are close to the second large
tubercle on the front. The cheeks are, however,
quite imperfect. The articulations of the back cannot
be distinguished from those of the tail. In our
specimen they are all beautifully distinct, and are
twenty-two in number. The posterior raised rim of
the buckler seems to form an articulation; its extremities
on each side are a good deal thickened and
expanded. The costal arches suddenly curve downwards
and backwards, near their middle, so as to divide
the abdomen and tail into five unequal sections.
The whole length is nearly three inches. The
breadth of the buckler nearly two inches.</p>

<p>This fine large Calymene was accidentally discovered
on the Helderberg mountain, by my friend,
Professor T. R. Beck. One of the loose pieces of
sandstone rolling over, near his feet, presented him
the fine natural mould, from which he has kindly permitted
our cast to be taken. The animal relic once
enclosed in this matrix, must still be near that locality,
and yet remains undiscovered, to reward the enterprise
of some more fortunate naturalist.</p>

<p>One of our models represents the natural mould
found by Dr. Beck. The other is a cast taken from
it and exhibits, more satisfactorily, the various parts
of the animal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">- 34 -</span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Calymene Microps.</span><a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> <i>Green.</i> Cast No. 6.</h4>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_17" href="#FNanchor_17" class="label">[17]</a> From the Greek for "small eyes."</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Clypeo antice subattenuato; occulis minimis in
lateribus capitis; abdominis articulis a 14 ad 18;
corpore depresso.</p>
</div>

<p>The buckler is semi-elliptical, slightly punctate, and
much depressed anteriorly; the front and cheeks are
not very distinctly marked. The eyes are very remote
from each other, being situated near the posterior
lateral angles of the head. They are not very
prominent, and exhibit no marks of being reticulated.
Before the eye on each side, there is a slight transverse
indentation. It is difficult to distinguish the
articulations of the abdomen from those of the tail.
They are from fourteen to eighteen in number. Where
the lateral lobes remain perfect, two narrow raised
lines appear between each of the ribs; these are most
evident on the caudal extremities of the animal. The
middle lobe is in the form of a long, slender, and
acute cone. The whole animal is an inch and a quarter
long, and is much more depressed than any other
Calymene which we have seen.</p>

<p>I am indebted to Mr. Titian R. Peale for the use of
the original from which our model was taken, his liberality
to those who cultivate Natural History is
proverbial, and needs no encomium from me. The
C. Microps is said to have been found near Ripley,
Ohio. It occurs in black limestone.</p>

<p>The eyes of this Calymene are small in comparison
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">- 35 -</span>
with those of some other species&mdash;particularly
the C. Bufo, C. Macrophthalma, and C. Anchiops.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Calymene Anchiops.</span><a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> <i>Green.</i> Cast No. 7.</h4>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_18" href="#FNanchor_18" class="label">[18]</a> From two Greek words which signify "eyes approximate."</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Clypeo antice, caudaque postice rotundatis; oculis
approximis, magnis, excertis; articulis vigenti;
corpore plano.</p>
</div>

<p>The buckler of this species is irregularly hemispherical;
the front pyriform and without pustulations.
The cheeks are almost entirely occupied by
the eyes, which are placed very near each other on
the upper part of the forehead; are very large and
trilobate, the side lobes being elongated and attenuated
in front. The articulations of the back are
twenty in number, those of the abdomen not being
distinguishable from those of the tail. The costal
arches of the side lobes are round near their extremities,
and are intersected with two or three raised
lines. Length nearly four inches. Breadth about
two inches.</p>

<p>It gives me great satisfaction in being able to describe,
and to present to naturalists a good cast of
this Calymene, which has excited for a long time so
much interest and perplexity. The original fossil
from which our plaster model was made is now deposited
in the cabinet of the Albany Institute, and is
the identical specimen from which a cast was long
since made, by Dr. Hosack of New York, a specimen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">- 36 -</span>
of which he sent in July, 1819, to the Royal Academy
of Science, in France. Professor Brongniart referred
the animal from which this model was taken,
though with much hesitation and doubt, to the species,
Calymene Macrophthalma. He remarks concerning it,
"Il est beaucoup plus gros que les autres
individus, et a pr&eacute;s de dneuf centim&egrave;tres de longueur.
C'est avec doute que je rapport&eacute; cette empreinte
tres-peu nette &agrave; l'esp&egrave;ce actuelle; mais malgr&eacute; ses
form&eacute;s obtuses, et l'absence de tout detail, elle est si
remarquable par la grosseur de ces yeux et par le
prolongement de son bouclier qu'on peut pr&eacute;sumer
qu'elle appartient an calym&eacute;ne macrophthalme, et
avec d'aut&agrave;nt plus de probabilit&eacute; qu'elle vient aussi
des Etats Unis d'Am&eacute;rique. Elle a &eacute;t&eacute; trouv&eacute;e,
suivant M. Hosack, dans un schiste." We have seen
the cast alluded to in the above note, and are not at
all surprised at the uncertainty which it has occasioned.
The apparent prolongation of the buckler is
entirely occasioned by the loss of a small fragment
from that portion of the head. The form and position
of the eyes, further distinguish it from any of
the numerous specimens of C. Macrophthalma, that
we have examined. The raised lines which we have
noticed as intersecting the costal arches of the lateral
lobes are remarkable, though they may have been
produced by accidental fissures in the epidermal
covering of the animal. The head of the C. Macrophthalma
is always marked by minute and prominent
granulations, like <i>shagreen</i>&mdash;nothing of this kind
appears on the buckler of the C. Anchiops.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">- 37 -</span></p>

<p>I am informed by my friend, Dr. T. R. Beck, to
whose liberality I owe this interesting species, that it
was found in Ulster county, New York. It was supposed
by Dr. Hosack, to have been discovered in the
vicinity of Albany. Respecting the locality and geological
relations of this trilobite, Professor Brongniart
remarks, "un mod&eacute;le en pl&acirc;tre de trilobite envoy&eacute;
&agrave; l'Acad&eacute;mie des Sciences, en Juillet, 1819,
par M. Hosack, et que j'ai rapport&eacute;, autant que la
chose &eacute;tait possible, et toujours avec doute, au
calym&eacute;ne macrophthalme, a &eacute;t&eacute; trouv&eacute; dans le territoire
d'Albany, &ecirc;tat de New York. Or, les environs
de cette ville sont indiqu&eacute;s, sur la carte g&eacute;ologique de
M. Maclure, comme form&eacute;s de terrains de transition.
M. Hosack dit qu'il a &eacute;t&eacute; trouv&eacute; au milieu d'un
rocher ardois&eacute;, c'est &agrave; dire, dans un schiste probablement
analogue &agrave; celui des environs d'Angers, qui
renferme les Ogygies, et ce trilobite ce rapproche un
peu de ce genre par la grosseur des tubercules qui
recouvrent les yeux on en tiennent la place." The
rock in which the Calymene Anchiops is found, appears
to be a clay slate.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Calymene Diops.</span><a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> <i>Green.</i> Cast No. 8, and fig. 2.</h4>

<div class="footnote">

</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Clypeo lobato plano; rugis tribus in lateribus
frontis; tuberculis oculiformibus, eminentissimis et
duplicibus; articulis octodecim; cauda rotunda.</p>
</div>

<p>This species is very distinct from every other Calymene
that we have seen. The outline of the buckler is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">- 38 -</span>
lobate lunate; the front is very convex, and a good
deal elevated above the cheeks or sides, from which
it is divided by a deep furrow; on the posterior margin
of the front on each side, close to the groove there
is a prominent circular tubercle, before which there
are three small transverse wrinkles. The cheeks are
subtriangular; the oculiform tubercle is near the posterior
superior angle, and is only separated from the
tubercle on the front, by the furrow or groove, so that
the animal seems to have had double eyes on each
side; there are two curved lines on each side below
the eyes, crossed near the front by a deep short canal.
The middle lobe of the abdomen and tail is rather
longer than the lateral lobes, and is rounded and very
prominent throughout. It is composed of 18 articulations,
seven of which appear to belong to the tail;
it is, however, somewhat difficult to define the length
of the tail with precision. The costal arches of the
lateral lobes, particularly those near the tail, are
bifurcate. Length almost three inches.</p>

<p>The original fossil, from which the cast was taken,
is in the New York Museum. I am indebted to Mr.
Rubens Peale, the liberal proprietor of that flourishing
and important institution, not only for the use of
it in this Monograph, but also for some valuable information
relating to other species. The precise
locality of Mr. Peale's specimen is not known, but
in the cabinet of J. P. Wetherill, Esq., there is a fine
head of the C. diops which was found in the State of
Ohio. Both specimens are mineralized by the same
kind of soft grey coloured limestone&mdash;and I have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">- 39 -</span>
but little doubt that they were derived from the same
place.</p>

</div>

<p>This species, according to Al. Brongniart, who first
described it, is remarkable for the magnitude and
protuberance of its eye-shaped tubercles, and by the
prolongation of the anterior portion of the buckler,
in the form of a snout.</p>

<p>The back is marked by 12 or 13 articulations,
which are thicker than those of the tail. The tail is
short, pointed, and without expansion.</p>

<p>The middle lobe, or front of the <i>buckler</i>, in this
calymene, is said by Brongniart to be marked on
its sides by three oblique plic&aelig; or wrinkles, but we
have not been able to discover this character in any
of the specimens to which we have access; neither
do they exhibit any remarkable prolongation in the
anterior portion of the <i>buckler</i>, as stated in his specific
character. The specimens which we have examined,
agree pretty well with the representation he
has given of the C. Macrophthalma, Plate I. fig. 5. A.
B. &amp; C. made from a drawing by Mr. Stokes, from
a fossil found in Coalbrookdale (Eng.).</p>

<p>This trilobite is common in several parts of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">- 40 -</span>
United States. According to Dr. J. E. Dekay,<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> the C.
Macrophthalma is found on the Helderberg mountains,
near Albany, and at Coshung creek, not far from
Seneca lake, in the State of New York. It occurs
also at Leheighton, in Pennsylvania&mdash;at the Falls of
the Ohio, and at several other localities. We have
examined a number of specimens of the C. Macrophthalma,
contained in the rich cabinet of fossils, in
the Academy of Natural Sciences, and have never
seen any individual which resembles the fig. 4, Plate
I. of Brongniart; and in no instance is the front of
the buckler marked by three oblique folds, a character
stated as peculiar to this species. The C. Macrophthalma,
(variety) occurs in large quantities in Leheighton
in Pennsylvania, and we are indebted to
Mr. D. Keim, for some fine specimens from that locality.</p>

to place the C. Macrophthalma among the species of

animal which is supposed to be the one intended by
Brongniart as the C. Macrophthalma of North America.
It is, in our opinion, a variety of the C. Bufo.
There can be no doubt that several species have been
confounded under the name of C. Macrophthalma.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_22" href="#FNanchor_22" class="label">[22]</a> We have seen in the Cabinet of Mr. Featherstonhaugh, a fine
group of trilobites, in the transition limestone, from Dudley,
(Eng.) Among them there is a perfect head, which agrees exactly
with the description given by Mr. Brongniart of the head
of his Calymene Macrophthalma. If this belongs to the true
macrophthalma, our species under that name is entirely distinct.
Since our work had been prepared for the press, Dr. J. J. Cohen,
of the Baltimore College, has shown us the fragment of a calymene
from Berkley, Virginia, which agrees with Brongniart's description
of the macrophthalma, and with the above fossil from
Dudley. We regret that the imperfection of the fossil prevents
our giving a satisfactory cast of it.</p>

</div>

<p>The following extract of a letter from Professor
Ducatel to the author, referring to the locality of this
species, will be read with interest.</p>

<p>"I cannot be positive as to my recollection of the
locality of the fossil referred to by Brongniart and
yourself, but believe it is one of several found by my
friend Dr. M'Culloh, in the neighbourhood of Berkley
Springs, Virginia. I regret that I have not in
my possession another specimen to present to you."</p>

<p>Buckler semilunate, front very large, rounded before
and arcuated at the insertion of the middle lobe;
surface convex, and marked with numerous depressed
pimples. Mouth large, lunate, resembling that of a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">- 42 -</span>
toad or frog, with a narrow raised rim on the upper
and under lip. Below the chin there are no pustulations.
Cheeks small, triangular, and separated from
the front by a deep, rectilinear furrow; the eyes in
our specimen are much injured, but they are large,
and near the upper angle of the cheeks. Middle lobe
with a series of distinct double articulations. Lateral
lobes wider than the middle lobe, ribs deeply grooved
near their insertion; articulations of the abdomen
twelve; of the tail ten. Length four inches and a
half; breadth of the buckler nearly two inches.</p>

<p>This fossil was presented to me some time since
by Thomas P. Johnson, Esq., who mentioned that it
was found in New Jersey, but that he could not learn
its precise locality. Near Patterson, in that State,
some trilobites have been discovered&mdash;perhaps the
C. Bufo may have been derived from that locality. It
is composed of a dark greyish limestone, easily cut
with a knife.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Calymene Bufo.</span> Variety, <span class="smcap">Rana</span>. Cast Nos. 11 &amp; 12.</h4>

<p>This fine specimen differs from the one above described,
in having the front of the buckler rather
smaller, and of a different contour. The whole of
the shell is also covered with granulations, which
only appear on the head of the other; this, however,
may be only an imperfection in the specimens in our
cabinet.</p>

<p>I am indebted to the Albany Institute for the originals
of the models Nos. 11 &amp; 12. They were found at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">- 43 -</span>
Seneca, Ontario County, New York, in dark, slaty
limestone, which also contains cubical crystals of
iron pyrites. A fortunate blow of the hammer has
fractured the rock which contains this trilobite, so
neatly, as to present us at the same time with the
petrified animal in an almost perfect state, and also
with the mould or matrix in which it was imbedded.
This arrangement is beautifully illustrated by our
models.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Genus Asaphus.</span> <i>Brongniart.</i></p>

<p>This genus derives its name from the Greek word
&#913;&#963;&#945;&#966;&#951;&#962;&mdash;obscure. It embraces perhaps more species
than any other genus of the family of trilobites.
About twenty have already been discovered. Most
of them are very characteristic and can easily be determined,
but as the genus Asaphus, is intermediate
between Calymene and Ogygia, it is sometimes a
little difficult to decide the genus to which the inosculating
species on each side, belongs.</p>

<p>In general, the Asaphs may be known by the body
being very much depressed, and by the membranaceous
development, which extends beyond the lateral lobes.
The middle lobe of the abdomen, is rarely more
than one-fifth the width of the body. As the abdomen
and tail of the Asaph are the only portions of
the animal commonly found entire, the distinctive
characters of the genus above given, may generally
be ascertained.</p>

<p>Professor Brongniart remarks, that the ribs of the
<i>Asaph</i>, which correspond in number and position to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">- 44 -</span>
the articulations of the middle lobe, "are sometimes
simple or undivided, at least in the post abdomen,
but that they are always bifurcated in the <i>Calymene</i>"
As far as our observations have extended, these remarks
do not apply either in the one case or the
other.</p>

<p>The head or buckler of the <i>Asaph</i>, is not so deeply
divided into three lobes as the <i>Calymene</i>; they are,
however, quite distinct. The oculiferous tubercles
are in some species exceedingly well marked by a reticulated
structure.</p>

<p>This genus often occurs at the same localities with
the Calymene, though in some instances it seems to
occupy rocks peculiar to itself. Dr. John Bigsby, in
his list of organic remains occurring in the Canadas,
states, that he never found a single species of the
genus Calymene, on the north side of the River St.
Lawrence, although the Asaphs were very abundant.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
In his Sketch of the Geology of the Island of Montreal,
he however observes: "Of Trilobites, the
Asaph genus is the most abundant, they approach
nearest the species <i>caudatus</i>, of Brongniart. I have
found no entire Calymene, but many bucklers or heads
of the Blumenbach species, some of them an inch
and a half in diameter. They are found whole in
considerable numbers in the vicinity of Quebec."<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The fragments of this species, which we have examined,
comprise ten articulations of the middle lobe,
and the corresponding ribs of the sides, all in a very
good state of preservation; the extent to which the
membranaceous expansion reached beyond the tail and
the lateral lobes is very apparent, but it has been unfortunately
broken off all round. Our specimen appears
to be a natural cast of the internal part of the
shell, or the coriaceous covering of the animal.</p>

<p>The portion of this specimen of trilobite which
still remains perfect, is two inches long, and three
inches and a quarter broad. The middle lobe exhibits
the appearance of a very exact and gradually tapering
cone, its articulations being rounded and
slightly flattened on the top. The ribs of the lateral
lobes are nearly straight, slightly arched, broad,
rounded, and gradually increase in width from the
point of their insertion; they are simple or not bifurcated
throughout, and are covered with very minute
granulations, which are probably produced by the
sandstone in which the animal is mineralized. The
membranaceous expansion near the caudal termination,
is a good deal prolonged.</p>

<p>The A. Laticostatus occurs in a light coloured
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">- 46 -</span>
ferruginous sandstone, which contains a multitude of
other fossil remains, particularly a large species of
Productus and of Terebratula. It is said to have
been found in Ulster county, in the State of New
York, by the late Charles Wilson Peale, Esq., the
distinguished founder of the Philadelphia Museum.
During the memorable search after the bones of the
<i>Mastodon Giganteum</i>, in the marl pits of that county,
this enterprising naturalist procured our Asaph with
many other remarkable petrifactions. The rocks
which contain them were probably found not <i>in situ</i>,
but were masses rolled from the neighbouring Shawangunk
mountains,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> which by some geologists are
supposed to be a link in the grand chain of the Alleghanies.
Mr. R. Peale, of New York, lately visited the
rich repository of fossils in Ulster County, and procured
a number of specimens of the A. Laticostatus,
all of which he has kindly permitted me to examine.
These are much smaller than our cast, but in many
instances the caudal elongation is perfectly developed.
The A. Laticostatus also occurs in the
Helderberg mountains, specimens of which are in the
Albany Institute.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_26" href="#FNanchor_26" class="label">[26]</a> The Lenape tribe of Indians, who formerly inhabited this

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">- 47 -</span></p>

<p>I am indebted to Professor Eaton, for two specimens
of this very interesting species. In his Geological
Text Book, he thus describes it: "Tail crescent-form,
or concavo-convex, with the convex side
forward, upon which the post abdomen terminates:
abdomen contains about 12 articulations, with an abrupt
termination equal in breadth to one-fourth of
the length of the transverse lunate tail; the articulations
of the side lobes gradually incline towards the
axis of the body, until the last pair terminate at the
tail. Found in transition limestone at Glenn's Falls,
and Becroft's mountain, near Hudson. I have a specimen
from Becroft's mountain, with part of the
original covering of the animal remaining."</p>

<p>When we first noticed the remarkable lunate appearance
of the tail of this Asaph, we supposed that
it was occasioned by some accident, but there seems
no doubt that this conformation is natural. In our
specimens of this species, which are not however perfect,
the articulations of the abdomen do not exceed
8 in number. The representation of this animal remain
given by Mr. Eaton, plate 1, figure 1, is exceedingly
inaccurate; it will confuse rather than illustrate
the subject. Our cast and the drawing, we believe,
are taken from the same specimen, which was kindly
loaned by Mr. Eaton for this work. It is but justice
to the amiable, industrious, and indefatigable author
of the Geological Text Book to remark, that he
regrets as much as any one, the insufficiency of his
figures of the trilobites, to give any correct idea of
the fossils they are intended to represent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">- 48 -</span></p>

<p>In the cabinet of the Albany Institute there are a
number of specimens of the A. Selenurus. One of
our models represents the natural mould made by
the animal in the rock; the other is an impression
taken from it, in order to exhibit the animal in a
more satisfactory manner.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Asaphus Limulurus.</span><a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> <i>Green.</i> Cast No. 16.</h4>

<p>It is very much to be regretted that the abdomen
and caudal end only of this remarkable Asaph have
hitherto been discovered; it is, however, exceedingly
gratifying that the fragment still remains in so perfect
a state. It forms a part of the magnificent cabinet
of organic remains belonging to J. P. Wetherill,
Esq., now deposited in the Academy of Natural
Sciences, of Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Dr. J. J. Cohen discovered a small specimen of
this species at Lockport, New York, which he has
presented to the Athen&aelig;um, in Baltimore.</p>

<p>Eight articulations of the abdomen, and ten of the
tail, are all of this fine species that we have seen.
The ribs, or costal arches of the abdomen have a
deep furrow on their upper surface, commencing at
the middle lobe, and terminating near their free extremities;
these extremities appear all detached from
each other, and end in reflected points or spines, so as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">- 49 -</span>
to give the side of the animal a serrate appearance.
The costal arches of the tail are grooved through
their whole extent, and present no spinous terminations.
Beyond the membranaceous expansion of the
tail, which is somewhat similar to that of the Asaphus
Caudatus, there projects a single spine, like
that from the tail of the <i>Limulus polyphemus</i>; this
spine may be traced under the caudal membrane to its
insertion into the middle lobe. A portion of the
crustaceous shell is still entire, and it seems to have
been covered with very minute granulations. A
row of large granulations may easily be traced on
each side of the middle lobe. Length of the fragment,
one inch and a half. Breadth one inch and a
fourth.</p>

<p>The A. Limulurus was found in the dark brown,
shaly limestone, at Lockport, in the State of New
York; it is associated in the same rock with the
terebratula and several other fossils.</p>

<p>The singular spinous projection from the tail of
this Asaph, furnishes another analogy, between the
trilobite and the limulus; an affinity which was suggested
by Dr. Dekay; and which has been argued
with great ingenuity both by himself and Professor
Wahlenberg.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>The middle lobe of the buckler is marked by three
transverse plic&aelig; or folds on its posterior part, and
its cheeks or lateral portions are triangular; the posterior
exterior angles of which, are acute, and considerably
elongated. The cheeks are furnished with
conical, truncated, semilunar and externally convex
tubercles, which were beyond all doubt the eyes of the
animal, being reticulated as in those of the Limulus.
The middle lobe of the back is narrow, and has twelve
articulations. The lateral lobes are composed of
double ribbed costal arches. Beyond the lateral lobes
and the caudal termination, there is a smooth, thick
membranaceous expansion, which forms an acute
projection below the central portion of the tail.</p>

<p>The specimen in the Philadelphia Museum, by
which I have identified this species, is marked as
coming from Ripley, Ohio. It reposes on a fragment
of ash coloured limestone&mdash;which contains also
a mutilated specimen of what seems to be a calymene,
and a few small terebratul&aelig;, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">- 51 -</span></p>

<p>Dr. John Bigsby, in his "List of Organic Remains,
occurring in the Canadas," states that the
A. caudatus is frequently met with, thrown up by the
water on the north shore of Lake Superior&mdash;on the
bank of Rainy river&mdash;at the Lake of the Woods, and
at several other places. In some localities they are
astonishingly numerous, and so small as to be almost
microscopic. They occupy indiscriminately limestone
of every colour, but are most numerous in that
which is brown or crystallized. They are composed
of the kind of limestone in which they happen to be
embedded.</p>

<p>We have seen a number of specimens of this species
in the Albany Institute, in Mr. Wetherill's cabinet,
and in the Baltimore Athen&aelig;um; but in all of them,
the abdomen and caudal extremity only remain perfect:
from their exact resemblance, however, to the
same parts of the A. caudatus, figured by Brongniart,
(plate 2, fig. 4, D.) we have no hesitation with regard
to their identity. The description which we have
given of the <i>buckler</i>, supposed to belong to our Asaph,
is therefore taken from Brongniart, whose specimens
were found at Dudley, the celebrated locality of the
C. Blumenbachii.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> The coriaceous membrane, which
extends beyond the lateral lobes and forms the caudal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">- 52 -</span>
termination of our species, is not covered with minute
dots, as in the European fossil; and if a new
name is to be applied to it on that account, it may be
called <i>A. glabratus</i>.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> M. Wahlenberg, has given
the figure of a trilobite which he calls <i>caudatus</i>, but
ours cannot be mistaken for that species, to which
Brongniart has very judiciously applied the name of
<i>A. meucronatus</i>.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_31" href="#FNanchor_31" class="label">[31]</a> In the first volume, 2d series, of the Transactions of the
Geological Society of London, Mr. Weaver has published some
highly interesting observations on the fossils found in Gloucestershire,
England. The A. caudatus, he states, is there found

</div>

<p>The conical eye-like protuberances on the head of
this species, are very remarkable, and so much resemble
the reticulated eyes of the limulus, as to

of vision.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Asaphus Hausmanni.</span> <i>Brongniart.</i></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Cauda rotundata; cute coriacea tuberculis minimis

</div>

<p>In De la Beche's Geological Manual, there is a
list, of the trilobites which have been discovered in
the grauwacke group of rocks. This list we have
given in our introduction. Among the trilobites he
states that the Asaphus Hausmanni has been found
in the United States; as we have not seen the species,
and presuming the author to be correct in his locality,
we give the following description from Professor
Brongniart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">- 53 -</span></p>

<p>I know, he observes, only the tail of this Asaph,
but it is so different from that of other trilobites, that
I do not hesitate to establish a particular species,
upon the consideration of this part alone. Its general
form is that of a semi-ellipsis; the middle lobe represents
a very slender cone. The arched ribs of the
lateral lobes are perfectly distinct and simple. I cannot
perceive in them the slightest appearance of bifurcation.
This sufficiently characterizes the species.
But that which further distinguishes it from the
others, are the small, elevated points, scattered, and
of course rough (serr&eacute;s), with which the skin or epidermis
is covered, resembling, in this respect, the
tail of the <i>Apus canceriformis</i>.</p>

<p>This fragment of an Asaph is in a homogeneous,
compact, blackish limestone, which contains no
other kind of petrifaction. I know not where it was
found. It is in the cabinet of M. de Dr&eacute;e.</p>

<p>On plate 2 of Professor Brongniart's work, he has
given figures to illustrate this species; fig. 3 A. represents
the whole fragment, and 3 B. two of the ribs
of the lateral lobes, magnified to show the arrangement
of the tubercles, which are very peculiar.</p>

<p>From the above description it will be readily perceived,
that the A. Hausmanni comes very near to
the A. Laticostatus. There are, however, many
striking differences, which will be obvious to those
who compare our cast with the figures of Brongniart.
The shape of the ribs, and the tubercles upon
them; the form of the middle lobe and of the interstices
between the articulations, are all peculiar to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">- 54 -</span>
each. The elongation of the tail in our species is
alone sufficient to distinguish it. We have always
been doubtful whether the minute granulations on
our species were not produced by the sandstone in
which it is petrified.</p>

<p>Upon what authority the A. Hausmanni has been
considered as a species belonging to the United
States we cannot determine. In the valuable and extensive
cabinet of trilobites belonging to the Albany
Institute, there are a number of specimens labelled
with this name by Professor A. Eaton. If we mistake
not, he mentioned to us that similar fragments
of this fossil were sent by him to Brongniart, who,
we understand, is the author of the list of trilobites
found in the manual of De la Beche. The specimens
which have been examined, both in the cabinet of
Professor Eaton, and in that of the Albany Institute,
are certainly not identical with the figures or descriptions
published of the A. Hausmanni. Professor
Eaton, in his Geological Text Book, at page 31,
thus describes his A. Hausmanni:&mdash;"Tail rounded,
and forming the middle of a circular arc whose centre
is in the fore abdomen, near the head; covering
tubercled or spined. Found in coral rag on the
south shore of Lake Erie. Also, in its underlaying
grit slate on the Helderberg." Some other trilobites
mentioned in De la Beche's list as occurring in the
United States, we have not been so fortunate as to
meet.</p>

part, however, appears to be in a good state of preservation.</p>

<p>The articulations of the abdomen and tail, which
cannot readily be distinguished from each other, are
seventeen in number. The middle lobe is flat, and
regularly tapers to an obtuse lip; it is marked on
each side with longitudinal impressed lines or little
grooves. The costal arches on their upper side have
a deep and narrow channel, running through their
whole course. The costal arches of the abdomen
have no membranaceous expansion beyond their terminations;
this organization is only visible immediately
below the end of the middle lobe, where it quickly
finishes in an acute point. A large portion of the
crustaceous shell remains, and is covered with distinct
granulations; those on the tail are the least
obvious.</p>

<p>This species approaches very near the A. caudatus,
but the grooves on the middle lobe, the smallness of
the costal arches, and the limited extent of the membranaceous
expansion round the lower portions of
the shell, will sufficiently distinguish it.</p>

<p>Two specimens of this Asaph are in the cabinet of

is embedded in a light grey coloured limestone shale.
The other specimen, which is much smaller, was discovered
near the Genessee River, in the State of New
York. The rock in which it occurs is identical in
its constitution with the other. It contains other
species of trilobites, and a number of shells.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_34" href="#FNanchor_34" class="label">[34]</a> From the Greek, for "minute tail."</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Cauda attenuata, acuta; corpore valde convexo;
costis striatis; parte marginali vix membranacea.</p>
</div>

<p>This fine, large caudal termination of an Asaph is
in the cabinet of the Albany Institute&mdash;and it is a
subject of great regret, that all that has yet been
discovered relating to this highly interesting trilobite,
is to be seen in this fragment.</p>

<p>There are eighteen articulations of the tail and
abdomen, which cannot be distinguished from each
other. The middle lobe is composed of a series of
straight, distinct, parallel articulations, very convex
about the middle, so as to form a kind of longitudinal
ridge down the back. The costal arches of the
lateral lobes are very distinct, and are longitudinally
striated or grooved on their upper surface, particularly
those near the upper part of the animal. The
membranaceous expansion is very narrow along the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">- 57 -</span>
sides of the body, and forms a sort of hem; below
the central portion of the tail it makes a short acute
projection, which seems to be supported by a short
costal elongation of the middle lobe. Length two
inches and a half.</p>

<p>The A. Micrurus was found in the black f&#339;tid
limestone of Trenton Falls, by M. H. Webster, Esq.,
and by him placed in the rich collection of trilobites
in the Albany Institute. The limestone in which
this Asaph is embedded, is almost one entire mass of
petrifactions. The general aspect of the A. Micrurus
is very similar to that of a calymene&mdash;but judging
from its structure, it could never contract its
shell into a spherical figure. Its minute tail, and
narrow membranaceous expansion round the terminal
edges of the lateral lobes are quite peculiar, and determine
it to be an Asaph.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Asaphus Wetherilli.</span><a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> <i>Green.</i> Cast No. 20.</h4>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_35" href="#FNanchor_35" class="label">[35]</a> I have named this species in compliment to my friend, John
P. Wetherill, Esq., whose magnificent cabinet of fossils in the
Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, will ever remain
as a monument of his discrimination, enterprise, and liberality.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Clypeo postice arcuato, sulcato; abdominis articulis
duodecim; cauda vix membranacea; cute coreacea
vix punctata.</p>
</div>

<p>The contour of this beautiful Asaph is very regularly
ovate; unlike most of the remains of this genus,
the buckler is still attached to the abdomen, though
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">- 58 -</span>
one of the <i>cheeks</i>, and a portion of the <i>front</i> are obscured
by the rock in which the animal is imbedded.
The cheeks form spherical triangles. The oculiferous
tubercles, though a good deal defaced, seem to
have been circular and not lunate, as in the A. Caudatus.
A raised, curved line passes from and over the
eye, between it and the lateral lobe of the abdomen.
The central lobe of the back is composed of twelve
double joints, and that of the tail of six single articulations;
where the epidermis or shell is perfect, all the
articulations appear single. The last joint of the tail
is longer than in any other of our species. The ribs
of the abdomen are rather broad, and have a deep
furrow scooped out along their upper surface; their
extremities, where they can be discovered, are detached
from each other, and terminate in reflected
points, like those of the A. Limulurus. The costal
arches of the tail are delicately grooved, and terminate
in the membrane. The membranaceous expansion
round the edge of the tail is very narrow, and
appears to form no projection beyond its central
part. The whole epidermis is finely marked with
granulations. Length one inch and three-fourths&mdash;breadth
one inch and one-fourth.</p>

<p>This interesting species was found in limestone
shale, near Rochester, in Munroe County, N. Y.; and
is now in the valuable cabinet of the Albany Institute.
An accidental fissure of the rock disclosed not only a
fine specimen of both the mould and the cast of this
animal, but also another individual of the same species
in contact with it. From the peculiar attitude
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">- 59 -</span>
which these fossilized animals maintain towards each
other, they appear to have been combatants at the
very moment when the catastrophe occurred which
produced their mineralization. In the Museum of
the Garden of Plants at Paris, there is a large specimen
of two fossil fish, which are supposed by many
to have been destroyed and covered with mineral
matter, when one of them was in the very act of
swallowing the other. Mr. Bake well, however, who
accurately examined this specimen, is of opinion,
that the two heads of the fish had been pressed together
by the superincumbent weight.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Genus Paradoxides.</span> <i>Brongniart.</i></h3>

<p>The animals arranged under this generic name, include
the organic remains described by Linn&eacute; as Entomolithus
paradoxus, and Brongniart has given the
specific appellation which the great Swedish naturalist
applied to these singular animals, out of compliment
to him, though he considers it quite inappropriate.
The late Professor Dalman calls this genus Olenus,
and quotes Paradoxides as a synonyme, but the term
of Brongniart seems to have the priority, and therefore
must be preferred.</p>

<p>The animals belonging to the Paradoxides have the
body very much depressed, and the lateral much
wider than the middle lobe.</p>

<p>The buckler is nearly semicircular, the cheeks are
destitute of eyes, and the front is marked with three
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">- 60 -</span>
transverse furrows. This last character is probably
not a permanent one.</p>

<p>But the most distinguishing character, is the prolongation
of the costal arches, particularly those of
the tail, beyond the membrane which they are supposed
to support; the termination of these arches is
in teeth or spines. Some species of the Asaph have
prolongated extremities to the ribs of the abdomen,
but we have never seen them on the arches of the tail.</p>

<p>This genus is said to comprise a great number of
species, but the only one found in North America, as
far as our knowledge extends, is that described by
J. J. Bigsby, in the fourth volume of the Journal of
the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.
As we have not seen the specimen, we add the description
of it in the author's own words.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Paradoxides Boltoni.</span> <i>Bigsby.</i> Figure 5.</h4>

<p>Oval, blind; surface with small tubercles and
stri&aelig;; clypeus rounded before; exterior angle extending
in a broad spine; abdomen fourteen jointed;
segments recurved, falcate; tail membranaceous and
serrate.</p>

<p>The shape of this individual is oval, approaching
ovate; it is moderately flat; the whole length is five
inches and four-fifths; its breadth across the middle
is four inches and nine-tenths; wherever the cutis is
not removed, it is covered profusely and irregularly
with small tubercles. The denuded portions in this
specimen, for the space of three quarters of an inch
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">- 61 -</span>
from the external margin, is, in a very small degree,
depressed, and displays a number of broken and continuous
stri&aelig;, parallel to that margin. There are no
traces of organs of vision. The buckler is nearly the
segment of a circle; anterior edge, in the present
case, imperfect; it is four inches and three-fifths
broad, and one inch and one-ninth long at the centre;
it joins the abdomen by a somewhat sinuous transverse
line; cheeks and front of equal breadth; the
former are flat, but rise at the sharp ridge by which
they unite with the front; they are triangular in
shape; their outer angles terminating by an acute
tip. The stri&aelig; mentioned above are here not quite
parallel to the external border; the front is a shallow
depression; rounded but tapering anteriorly; it is intersected
from above on each side obliquely towards
the mesial line, by a ridge bifurcating downwards;
another smaller ridge nearly bisects the front perpendicularly.</p>

<p>The abdomen and post abdomen are not distinct.
The abdomen exclusive of the cauda is three inches
and a half long; it exhibits fourteen cost&aelig; varying
indiscriminately from one-fifth to one-fourth of an
inch in breadth, except the three inferior ones, which
are rather broader; they occupy the whole abdomen
without membranous interspaces, and are separated
by a black sulcus, not always well defined, and
sometimes a line in diameter. Each costa is canaliculated
from the upper and under angle to the tip.</p>

<p>The middle lobe is separated from the lateral by a
shallow, rude sulcus, which however, does not always
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">- 62 -</span>
destroy the continuity of the cost&aelig;, as they cross
it; this lobe is slightly convex, one inch and a half
broad at the top, and so continues to the sixth costa,
after which it gradually contracts, until at the bottom
it is one-fifth of an inch broad, subsiding insensibly
into a flat membrane-like surface; its longitudinal
sulci pass one inch farther downwards, and expanding
a little, unite with the cost&aelig; on each side the
posterior edge of the space included by them, being
dentated.</p>

<p>The lateral lobes are quite flat, one inch and a half
broad anteriorly, and, by gradual prolongation, become
at the fourth costa one inch and four-fifths in
breadth; this dimension is maintained to the ninth
articulation, when it slowly decreases to one inch at
the bottom; the recurvature of the cost&aelig; is gentle in
the upper eight, but then decreases rapidly. Their
extremities, advancing two-fifths and four-fifths of an
inch into the embedding rock, are falcate with their
raised black edges, and clearly marked points.</p>

<p>This trilobite was found by Lieut. Bolton, at Lockport,
in the state of New York, in the black, shaly,
horizontal limestone forming the lower part of the
ravine by which the Erie canal ascends the <i>parallel
ridge</i> of Lake Ontario. Dr. Bigsby remarks on this
locality, "I am not prepared to assign to this limestone
its exact place in the series of geological formations;
it is above the saliferous sandstone, and
therefore more recent than the rocks best known as
abounding in trilobites." We have, therefore, in this
instance, another fact, which demonstrates that blind
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">- 63 -</span>
trilobites are not confined to a geological period
more remote than That which has produced the animals
with oculiferous tubercles.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Genus Ogygia.</span> <i>Brongniart.</i></h3>

<p>In the vast quarries of slate at Angers, in France,
there is frequently noticed two very remarkable organic
remains, which have for a long time excited the
attention of naturalists. To receive these curious
relics, Professor Brongniart established the genus,
Ogygia, which he thus characterizes. Body much
depressed&mdash;elongated into an ellipse, terminated in
points&mdash;nearly equal at its extremities, and not capable
of contracting itself into a spherical form. The
buckler is bordered by a slight longitudinal furrow,
rising from its anterior extremity, and its posterior
angles terminating in elongated points. The abdomen
has eight articulations, and its longitudinal lobes
are not very prominent. The eyes are neither prominent
nor reticulated and there are no other protuberances
on the buckler.</p>

<p>In Professor Brongniart's original work on the Trilobites,
he has described the two specimens from
Angers, under the specific names of Guettardi, and
Desmarestii, in compliment to M. M. Guettard and
Desmarest; and in De La Beche's Manual of Geology,
we are informed that he has since identified two
other species; one of which is supposed to be found
in North America; this he calls <i>Ogygia Sillimani</i>;
the banks of the Mohawk River, near Schenectady,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">- 64 -</span>
is the locality from which it is said to have been derived.</p>

<p>As we have not been able to find any detailed account
of this species, we have admitted both it and
the genus to which it is said to belong into our Monograph
exclusively on the high authority of Professor
Brongniart, as quoted in the Manual of Geology.
We are not ignorant of the species of Trilobites found
near Schenectady, and if permitted to offer a suggestion
on this subject, it would be, that the description
of the American ogygia, was made out by its distinguished
author from the fragment of an Isotelus.
The Isotelus is not uncommon in that vicinity, and
one of its extremities might, even by a very close
observer, be mistaken for that of an Ogygia&mdash;especially
by those who are not perfectly familiar with
the Isotelus.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Genus Isotelus.</span> <i>Dekay.</i></h3>

<p>This fine genus of trilobites was established
November, 1824, by my friend James E. Dekay, M. D.
It embraces a considerable number of species so
analogous to each other, that except in a very few
cases, it is exceedingly difficult to point out their distinctive
characters. Some of the species of Isotelus,
appear to have reached a greater size than any other
trilobite. In the cabinet of P. A. Browne, Esq., there
is the fragment of one, which must have been fourteen
or fifteen inches long.</p>

<p>The Isotelus is found in several parts of North
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">- 65 -</span>
America, but most abundantly in the black transition
limestone, in the northern section of the country.
The richest locality, not only of this genus, but also
of the Calymene and the Asaph, is Trenton Falls,
on West Canada Creek, about 13 miles to the north
of Utica, in the state of New York. The following
extracts from the notes of Professor Renwick, which
accompany Dr. Dekay's account of the Isotelus, will
give some idea of this vast depository of the medals
of ancient zoology. West Canada Creek, is one of
the principal branches of the Mohawk River. At
Trenton Falls it has worn itself a passage through
the rock for the distance of nearly two miles, forming
a series of water falls; and has thus laid open to view
the strata to the depth of probably 300 feet. The
layers of the rock thus disclosed are nearly horizontal,
and of various thicknesses: they are composed
of limestone, with the exception of numerous thin
veins of argillaceous matter. The higher strata are
composed of carbonate of lime nearly pure, of a light
grey colour and crystalline structure. At greater
depths it is more compact and darker in colour, and
finally it appears quite black and highly f&#339;tid.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_36" href="#FNanchor_36" class="label">[36]</a> See Annals of N. Y. Lyceum, vol. i. page 185.</p>

</div>

<p>Animal remains are contained in every part of the
rock; besides several genera of trilobites, we have
several species of orthocera. Encrinites and
Fungites&mdash;Nautili&mdash;Terebratul&aelig; and Producti, are quite
common. The favosites here are sometimes six
inches in diameter, and in such numerous columns,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">- 66 -</span>
as to have induced the late worthy proprietor of this
interesting spot, Mr. J. Sherman, to consider them
as analogous in structure to the basaltic columns of
Staffa and the Giant's Causeway; he therefore maintains
the extravagant theory that these columns are
nothing more than gigantic favosites.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> We visited
this famous locality of trilobites not long since, and
were almost as much delighted with the sublimity
and grandeur of the cataract, and the picturesque
and romantic character of the glen, as with the reliques
of olden times, which are scattered here in
such profusion.</p>

<p>The genus Isotelus, derived from &#7993;&#963;&#959;&#962;, equal, and
&#964;&#949;&#955;&#959;&#962;, extremity, is thus characterized by Dr. Dekay.</p>

<p><i>Body</i> oval often contracted, not unfrequently extended.</p>

<p><i>Head</i> or buckler large and rounded, equalling the
tail in size, but with two oculiform tubercles.</p>

<p><i>Abdomen</i> with eight articulations.</p>

<p>Frontal process beneath, with two semilunar terminations.</p>

<p><i>Post abdomen</i> or tail, broad, expanded with indistinct
divisions, as large as the buckler.</p>

<p>Longitudinal lobes very distinct.</p>

<p>Other distinguishing marks by which this genus
may be known, have been given in our introduction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">- 67 -</span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Isotelus Gigas.</span> <i>Dekay</i>. Casts Nos. 21 and 22.</h4>

<p><i>Head</i> representing a spherical triangle, surface
punctate, convex, descending from between the eyes
to the anterior border, which has a narrow raised
rim; posterior extremity concave and corresponding
to the articulation of the abdomen. Eyes elevated,
prominent, sub-pedunculated; cornea oblong, lunated,
highly polished; <i>abdomen</i> with eight distinct articulations,
the middle lobe double the size of the lateral
one: these latter are continuous with the middle
lobe, have a deep furrow impressed on their upper
surfaces, which becomes gradually effaced towards
their narrow free extremities. These lateral lobes
are rounded at their extremities, and flattened in such
a manner as to allow each lobe to slide easily under
the lobe immediately preceding. <i>Tail</i> subtriangular,
convex, equalling the head in size, with the posterior
termination rounded. On the centre of its surface,
when accidentally decorticated, a slight elevation
may be traced, if the specimen be held in a certain
light, which appears to be a continuation of the middle
lobe; this extends to within a short distance of
the posterior angle of the tail, when it is either entirely
effaced or terminates in an abrupt truncation.
Another elevation runs parallel to and at a short distance
from the edge of the tail. These elevations
are connected by obscure parallel lines, imitating
the spaces between the lateral lobes. When the tail is
fractured on the borders, a semilunar depression is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">- 68 -</span>
visible, exhibiting concentric stri&aelig;. The whole Surface
of the animal has a jet black polish. Length
from 6 to 12 inches.</p>

<p>The original of our cast is in the cabinet of J. P.
Wetherill, and was found near Cincinnati, Ohio. It is
of a yellowish colour, and occurs in argillaceous slate.
Specimens are common in most cabinets of American
fossils. The Lyceum in New York, possesses a
fragment of an individual of this species, which must
have been at least 17 inches long. Our cast, No. 22,
is from the gigantic tail in the cabinet of P. A. Brown,
Esq. Mr. Stokes describes the I. gigas as a new
species under the name of Asaphus Platycephalus, in
Geolog. Trans. vol. i. N. Series. His specimen was
found in the limestone of. St. Joseph's, Canada.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Isotelus Planus.</span><a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> <i>Dekay.</i> Cast No. 23.</h4>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_38" href="#FNanchor_38" class="label">[38]</a> The general usage of naturalists is to prefix a short Latin
caption to the species which they discover&mdash;but as some authors
do not follow this fashion, we are satisfied to suffer their descriptions
to stand without it. We believe, indeed, that the time is
not very distant, when every author will be expected to publish
his discoveries in his vernacular tongue.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Head</i> more rounded than the preceding, and less
elevated. <i>Tail</i> flat, rounded. Total length two inches
and one-tenth. Breadth one inch and one-tenth.
Length of the head, six-tenths&mdash;of the abdomen,
eight-tenths, and of the tail seven-tenths.</p>

<p>Dr. Dekay is of opinion that this species may possibly
prove to be the young of the preceding. The
relative proportions of its buckler and tail vary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">- 69 -</span>
considerably from those of the I. gigas; and the
depth of the lateral lobes, which exceeds three-tenths
of an inch, would almost of itself determine it to be
a new species. The original, from which our cast
was taken, is in the cabinet of J. P. Wetherill. It
was found near Newport, Kentucky, and occurs in
argillaceous slate. The fossil is of a dirty yellow
colour.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Isotelus Cyclops.</span><a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> <i>Green.</i> Cast No. 24. Fig. 7.</h4>

</div>

<p>The head of this species is much more elongated
than it is in the two preceding species. The anterior
portion of the buckler is much prolonged. The eyes
are approximate, rounded, and near the posterior
edge of the head. The abdomen is furnished with
eight distinct articulations; the middle lobe is scarcely
broader than the lateral lobes; tail rather broader
than the head, and ovate; posterior termination more
rounded than the buckler. Length nearly three inches.</p>

<p>The specimen from which our model was taken
belongs to the Albany Museum. No label is attached
to it, but I was informed by Mr. Meach, one of
the proprietors, that it was found in the western part
of the State of New York. It is embedded in an ash-coloured
limestone. The specimen is a good deal
worn&mdash;but the peculiar form of the eyes, and the narrowness
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">- 70 -</span>
of the middle abdominal lobe, clearly distinguish
it from either of Dr. Dekay's species.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Isotelus Megalops.</span><a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> <i>Green.</i> Cast No. 25.</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Clypeo antice subrotundato, postice arcuato; oculis
magnis, rotundis, eminentissimis; cauda suborbiculari,
limbo lato; articulis abdominis octo.</p>
</div>

<p>The buckler in its contour resembles very much
the head of the I. gigas; it is, however, rather more
rounded before, and arcuated behind. The oculiferous
tubercles, are very peculiar, being very large,
round, and exceedingly prominent. They have a
good deal the appearance of solid hemispheres
placed on the forehead of the animal. They are exactly
on a line with the two abdominal furrows. The
abdomen is composed of eight distinct articulations;
the middle lobe is rather larger than the lateral
lobes. The tail is suborbicular, convex, and rather
less than the head. Length nearly five inches.
Breadth almost three inches.</p>

<p>This magnificent Isotelus was obtained near Trenton
Falls, in New York, by P. A. Browne, Esq., and
now forms a part of his fine collection of fossils, in
this city. It occurs in black transition limestone.
It differs essentially from the I. gigas of Dekay, in
the magnitude, collocation, and contour of the eyes.
Those of the I. gigas are oblong and lunate, and
nearly half the distance between the anterior and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">- 71 -</span>
posterior edges of the buckler; those of the I. Megalops
are not only much larger, but they are round,
and very near the posterior border of the head.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Isotelus Stegops.</span><a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Green. Casts Nos. 26 and 27.</h4>

</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Clypeo antice, caudaque postice attenuatis; cute
coreacea punctis minimis.</p>
</div>

<p>The head of this species is nearly in the form of a
spherical triangle; its anterior edge is vertically flattened
all round, but does not produce a narrow raised
rim, such as is described by Dr. Dekay, to belong to
the I. gigas. The eyes are prominent, and rather
nearer the lateral edge of the buckler, than to its posterior
border. The shell of the buckler forms a remarkable
projection over the top of each oculiferous
tubercle, something like an eye-lid. Continuous
with the edge of this cuticular projection, there is a
curved linear depression, which terminates on both
sides, at the edge of the buckler. This kind of
suture, though remarkably developed in this species,
is not peculiar to it, being more or less distinct in
most of the Isoteli. The articulations of the abdomen
are lost; there can be little doubt, however, that
they were eight in number. The tail is subtriangular,
and less in magnitude than the buckler.</p>

<p>This fossil is among the number of fine specimens
in the cabinet of J. P. Wetherill. It is in a rolled or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">- 72 -</span>
contracted attitude, and is somewhat distorted. We
have given, however, models of the head and the tail,
in two distinct pieces. The external shell, or calcareous
covering, is more perfect in this specimen
than in any other we have ever seen. A considerable
portion of the under side of the anterior part of
the buckler, is also well preserved, and perfectly coincides
with the figure and description given of it by
Dr. Dekay and Mr. Stokes. There is another fragment
of an Isotelus in the cabinet of Mr. Wetherill,
showing eight articulations of the abdomen, which
probably belongs to another individual of this species.
The dorsal shell is in a high state of preservation.
This species is embedded in clay slate, and
was found in Newport, Kentucky.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Genus Cryptolithus.</span> <i>Green.</i></h3>

<p>Among the numerous organic relics embedded
in black limestone at Trenton Falls, in the State of
New York, there is often found the fragment of a trilobite
which cannot properly be referred to any of
the genera already mentioned. Dr. J. Bigsby, in his
Sketch of the Geology of the Island of Montreal, has
figured and described a fossil which occurs at that
place, which approaches in its specific characters to
the fragments found at Trenton&mdash;but he does not
suggest for his relic any name. Professor Brongniart
has also represented, plate 4, figs. 5 and 7 A.
B. C., the fragments of trilobites from Russia and
from Llandillo, in Wales, which seem to differ but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">- 73 -</span>
little from those above noticed, these are also without
names. Under such circumstances, we have
thought it expedient to group these relics under
the generic term of Cryptolithus, a name analogous
to Calymene, Asaphus, Ogygia, and Agnostus, and
which may with propriety be applied to the animal,
should it ever be discovered entire.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>The Cryptolithus Tessellatus, resembles a good

The figure of this animal given by Brongniart, table
3, fig. 7, appears to be quite imperfect, and is very
unlike, except in the buckler, the representation of
Wahlenberg's fossil, given by Dalman, table 2, fig.

Granulatus are much more elongated than those of
the C. Tessellatus, it may perhaps be another species
of the same genus.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>The animal described and figured by Dr. J. Bigsby,
to which we have already referred, seems rather
different from our species. His specimens were
found at Montmorenci, near Quebec, (Canada) more
than an inch and a half in diameter. The following
are his remarks on this trilobite.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> "The front of
the buckler is remarkably convex, and has on each
side near the base, three very small transverse lines,
scarcely to be called depressions, corresponding to
the sulci so strongly marked in the genus Calymene.
There is frequently, but not universally, a very minute
pisiform process on the centre of the front. The
whole upper edge of the buckler is always surrounded
by a very ornamental semicircular border, sometimes
semi-elliptical, of punctures placed in the
meshes of a net-work in high relief and arranged
close together, in rays, passing perpendicularly from
the buckler and forming at the same time when observed
transversely, curved lines parallel to its upper
rim or edge, excepting at the sides, where they diverge,
leaving a space occupied by other lines of dottings,
parallel to the former, but speedily terminating
on the cheeks of the buckler. The lines which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">- 76 -</span>
are complete from side so side, are four in number.
The imperfect additional ones, vary from two to
four; the smallest and inner, consisting only of two
or three punctures. A plain edging includes the semicircle
of punctures. In the beds of these casts,
the places of the punctures are shown by small conical
elevations, and those of the ridges of the net-work,
by corresponding depressions."</p>

History, N. Y. p. 214.</p>

</div>

<p>Should this prove to be a distinct species, we propose
to call it <i>Cryptolithus Bigsbii</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Nuttainia Concentrica</i> of Professor Eaton seems
also very nearly allied to this species; he describes
it as having "four or five concentric arcs of punctures
in front of the buckler, separated by alternating
arcs of fine elevated ridges." The genus Nuttainia,
to which he refers this species, cannot include it,
and the N. Sparsa; for these two relics have scarcely
a single essential character in common; we have,
therefore, confined the genus Nuttainia, to the species
which he calls <i>Sparsa</i>.</p>

<p>The Cryptolithus Tessellatus is very common at
Trenton falls. In the transition limestone at Glenn's
falls, in the state of New York, during a very short
visit to this place, Dr. R. Harlan procured a large
number of this fossil, but only the buckler, the
projecting front of which exhibited a pisiform protuberance
above the level of the strata. Mr.
Eaton says that the N. Concentrica "occurs in the
wacke variety of transition of argillite, on the Champlain
canal," between the town of Waterford and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">- 77 -</span>
Mohawk river. The specimen in my cabinet, from
which our cast was made, is from that place.</p>

<p>The Cryptolithus Tessellatus occurs also in the
limestone which, according to Dr. Bigsby, overlays
the sandstone in the island of Montreal. At most of
its localities, it is associated with the Isotelus, the
Calymene, and with several species of Asaphus. The
Cryptolithus, which is entirely destitute of eyes, being
thus found with the oculiferous species, is an interesting
fact, and controverts the opinion of Professor
Wahlenberg, that the trilobites, which are without
eyes belong to a geological epoch more ancient than
those which are furnished with oculiform tubercles.
That organic remains furnish us with the most satisfactory
evidence of the identity or dissimilarity of
certain formations, is a disputed point with some
geologists<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> It cannot reasonably be doubted, that
new and isolated facts have been made the basis of a
too hasty generalization. On this subject Count
Rasoumowsky makes the following remarks:&mdash;"Les

non plus pouvoir &ecirc;tre d&eacute;termin&eacute;s avec quelque pr&eacute;cision.

<h3><span class="smcap">Genus Dipleura.</span> <i>Green.</i></h3>

<p><i>Body</i>, contractile, not much depressed, and slightly

with oblique, annular, oculiferous tubercles.</p>

<p><i>Abdomen</i>, with fourteen articulations, not lobate,
the ribs double.</p>

<p><i>Tail</i>, suborbicular, not so large as the buckler,
covered with an epidermis.</p>

<p>This genus derives its name from two Greek words,
which signify double ribs; many of the trilobites are
thus characterized; but in no species, is this organization
so remarkable as in those which belong to the
Genus Dipleura. The expansion of the tail resembles,
in some degree, that of the Isotelus, but other
obvious characters sufficiently distinguish it from
that interesting genus. The fossils arranged under
this section are larger than most other trilobites.</p>

<p>Clypeo lunato punctato; abdomine quatuordecim
articulis duplicibus vix lobatis; cauda suborbiculari;
limbo lato convexo integerrimo; oculis oblique deflexis.</p>

<p>The buckler is subtriangular, and covered with
granulations; the anterior portion of our specimen
being mutilated, we cannot determine its form exactly.
The cheeks are very prominent, and swell up gradually
towards the oculiferous protuberances, which are oblique,
and marked at their apex with a depression,
so as to give them an annular appearance. The abdomen
is crossed by fourteen double distinct articulations,
not interrupted in their course, by the two
longitudinal furrows, so common in most of the trilobites;
but owing to certain curves or irregularities
in the ribs near their lateral termination, a trilobate
appearance may in some specimens be detected.
Tail suborbicular, convex, and covered with a thick
epidermis.</p>

<p>The specific name of this species was given in compliment
to Dr. James E. Dekay, of New York, whose
valuable paper on the genus Isotelus, first directed
my attention to the American trilobites.</p>

<p>The D. Dekayi has been found in several districts
of the United States; at Lockport in the State of
New York, it is not uncommon. The small specimen
from which our cast of the abdomen and caudal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">- 80 -</span>
end was taken, is in the fine cabinet of Mr. William
Hyde, who permitted me to use it with his wonted
liberality and kindness. It is said to have been found
in Northumberland, Pennsylvania, and occurs in grey
carbonate of lime. In the Philadelphia Museum,
there is a fine fragment of this species, in which there
is embedded some crystals of iron pyrites; it was obtained
in Ulster County, New York. In the cabinet
of the Academy of Natural Sciences, there is a longitudinal
and hollow fragment, filled with ochre, and
the oxide of iron; it is labelled from Lockport, New
York. At Mount Hope Institution, near Baltimore,
there is also a good specimen from the same locality.
In the <i>Clinton collection</i>, owned by the Albany Institute,
there is a large extended fragment, nearly five
inches long. It is embedded in brown limestone,
and was found in Madison County, N. Y. There are
twelve articulations of the abdomen remaining, and
the epidermal covering of the tail is distinctly marked
with numerous dots. In the same collection there is
another large fragment of this species, consisting of
the tail and fourteen articulations. It was found in
Steuben County, New York; and occurs in grey
limestone. It is slightly contracted and very much
depressed laterally. There is also a head in the same
kind of limestone, from Cazenovia, Madison County,
New York. In the cabinet of the Institute there is
another specimen of this species, about six inches
in length, and nearly perfect; it is also embedded in a
similar rock, and was brought from Rochester, Munroe
County, New York.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">- 81 -</span></p>

<p>The original of the head from which our cast was

<h3><span class="smcap">Genus Trimerus.</span><a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> <i>Green.</i></h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_46" href="#FNanchor_46" class="label">[46]</a> From the Greek for "three divisions."</p>

</div>

<p><i>Body</i>, contractile, tapering, compressed.</p>

<p><i>Buckler</i>, pustulous, indistinctly lobate, with only
two small elevated oculiferous tubercles.</p>

<p><i>Abdomen</i>, with thirteen distinct, double articulations
divided into three lobes by a slight longitudinal furrow.</p>

<p><i>Flanks</i>, or lateral lobes, not so broad as the middle
lobe.</p>

<p><i>Tail</i>, tapering to an obtuse point, pustulous, and
marked with ten articulations.</p>

<p>This genus resembles in some respects both the
Calymene and Dipleura. The form of the buckler,
the position and structure of the oculiferous tubercles,
and the scarcely lobate divisions of the abdomen,
will readily distinguish it from the Calymenes.
The articulations of the tail, not being
covered with a shelly crust, is a character too obvious
to confound it with the genus Dipleura. There
is, we think, a beautiful chain of gradations of resemblances,
between the Isotelus, Dipleura, Hemicrypturus
and Trimerus. The lobes of the abdomen of
the Isotelus are very distinct, and the articulations
of the tail are hid by a broad thick shelly crust. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">- 82 -</span>
lobes in the Dipleura are scarcely apparent, the
ribs more numerous; and the covering of the tail
much smaller. The lobes of the Hemicrypturus are
like those of the Isotelus; but the lateral ones only
of the tail are covered. In the genus Trimerus the
lobes are like those of Dipleura, but the articulations
of the tail are exposed.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Trimerus Delphinocephalus.</span> <i>Green.</i> Cast No. 32,

<p>In the rich cabinet of American fossils in the
Albany Institute, there are two fine specimens of this
species, and I am indebted to that rising and liberal
institution, for the use of them in the present work.
Our cast is made from the smaller and more perfect
specimen of the two. The outline of the buckler
forms an irregular semi-ellipse. The front is convex
between the eyes, and very much depressed anteriorly,
so as to form a sharp edge. The posterior part
of the buckler is marked with a transverse groove
parallel with the articulations of the back. The
cheeks are small and triangular; the small elevated
eye-shaped tubercles being placed in the middle,
nearly equidistant from each of the angles. The
eyes are not reticulated, the summit of each tubercle
only presenting a plain oval foramen. The middle
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">- 83 -</span>
lobe of the abdomen is much broader than the lateral
lobes, and has 13 distinct, double articulations. The
side lobes are curved, and each costal arch is flattened
anteriorly near their lower extremities, no doubt
for the purpose of enabling the animal to roll itself
into a ball. The tail is tapering, and is composed of
ten articulations. The crustaceous covering is here
more thickly deposited than on any other part. The
entire shell seems to have been covered with minute
elevated dots; these are beautifully distinct on the
buckler and on the tail. Whole length of the specimen
described, not quite two inches.</p>

<p>The other specimen of this species in the cabinet
of the Albany Institute, is a large caudal end, three
inches and a half long, entirely perfect. Both of
these fossils were brought from Williamsville, Niagara
county, New York. They occur in a dark shelly
limestone, filled with other petrifactions. The calcareous
matter which has mineralized the trilobite,
in this instance, as in most others, is of a much darker
hue than the surrounding rock.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Genus Ceraurus.</span> <i>Green.</i></h3>

<p><i>Body</i>, very much depressed, and slightly tapering.</p>

<p><i>Buckler</i>, scarcely trilobate; cheeks large, flat, with
small remote oculiform tubercles; posterior angle of
the buckler spinous.</p>

<p><i>Abdomen</i>, with twelve articulations.</p>

<p><i>Tail</i>, rounded at the end, but terminating on each
side with two slightly curved spines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">- 84 -</span></p>

<p>The name of this genus is derived from the remarkable
spinous projections from the caudal end; this
peculiar organization separates it widely from the
other genera. The <i>Paradoxides Spinulosus</i> of Wahlenberg,
which is supposed to be the old <i>Entomolithus
Paradoxus</i> of Linn&eacute;, the fossil, with which all the trilobites
were for a long time confounded, has not
only projecting spines from the tail, but from all the
costal arches of the lateral lobes. The presence of
eyes or of oculiferous tubercles in the <i>Ceraurus</i>, would
alone be sufficient to separate it from the genus to
which that interesting fossil belongs. In the eighth
volume of Annales des Sciences Naturelles, Count
Rasoumowsky has figured and described the fragment
of a very curious relic, which seems to be an
intermediate link between our genus and paradoxides;
in addition to a number of filamentous elongations
of the costal arches, a curved spine seems to
project from the end of the tail, as in the <i>A. limulurus</i>.
No name is given to this trilobite, which appears to
have been found on the banks of the Yaousa, near
Moscow, where it occurs in black, coarse, argillaceous
schistus. The Ceraurus is probably a very rare animal
remain, as we have only met with it, in the unrivalled
cabinet of trilobites belonging to the Albany
Institute.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Ceraurus Pleurexanthemus.</span> <i>Green.</i> Cast No. 33.

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">- 85 -</span>
in spinam arcuatam acutam utrinque extenso.</p>
</div>

<p>The exact contour of this species cannot be perfectly
ascertained from our specimen; it seems, however,
to have been lunate. The horns of the crescent
which form the posterior angles, are very distinct,
and they project like curved spines, some distance on
each side of the head. The middle lobe or front is
faintly scalloped on each side along the cheeks. The
cheeks are rather large, and are furnished with two
small oculiform tubercles, very remote from each other,
and quite near to the anterior portion of the buckler.
The abdomen is composed of twelve articulations.
The lateral lobes of the abdomen are flat, and each of
the ribs, at about half their extent, is marked on the
upper surface, with an elevated pimple. These little
pustules are nearly on a line with the oculiferous tubercles
of the buckler, and present two parallel ranges
down the body, one on each side of the middle lobe,
and are terminated by a curved spine, which projects
to some distance beyond the tail of the animal.
Length one inch and a fourth.</p>

<p>This remarkable organic relic was found near
Newport, in the State of New York. It is embedded
in black limestone shale, and so exceedingly depressed
is this animal, that a very thin lamen of the slate
removed from the surface would destroy every vestige
of its appearance. I am indebted to my early
friend, Professor T. R. Beck, for the use of this valuable
petrifaction, which now belongs to the cabinet
of the Albany Institute.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Genus Triarthrus.</span> <i>Green.</i></h3>

<p><i>Body</i>, slightly convex; contractile?</p>

<p><i>Buckler?</i></p>

<p><i>Abdomen</i>, with three articulations, side lobes
longitudinal, narrow, and wedge-shaped.</p>

<p><i>Tail</i>, broad, rounded, without any membranaceous
expansion.</p>

<p>The name of this genus is derived from the circumstance,
that the abdomen has but <i>three</i> articulations;
an organization which is very peculiar. These
curious fossil animals are very abundant in the rocks
in which they are found; but though I have examined
a multitude of specimens from different localities, no
vestige of the head or buckler could, on the most minute
examination, be discovered. Whether these animals,
during their petrifaction, were so contorted or
rolled up, as to bring the extremities of the body together,
in such a manner as to present the posterior
folded part only to the view; or whether the buckler
has been destroyed by the process of mineralization,
as appears frequently to happen with the asaphs, we
are at a loss to determine.</p>

<p>The animal remains which belong to the genus
Triarthrus, differ so much in their' form and general
characters from all the other trilobites, that we perhaps
ought to regard them as forming another race of beings.
They are, however, more nearly allied to this
family than the Agnosti of Professor Brongniart.</p>

</div>

<p>The only portions of this fossil which have yet been
found, are the abdomen and tail. The abdomen is
composed of three joints; the first passes from the
side lobes completely over the body, and on its upper
surface, near the middle of the back, there is often a
minute elevated pimple. The other two, pass obliquely
from the lateral lobes, and are interrupted in
their course over the body. The tail, or posterior
portion, is expanded, something like that of the Isotelus
or Dipleura, and has a deep puncture on each
side, about half the distance between its terminal
border and the last articulation of the abdomen. The
lateral lobes are unlike those of any other genus.
They form narrow cuneiform appendages to the sides;
near the first joint of the abdomen they are crossed
transversely by an elevated ridge, from which they
gradually taper along the sides of the body, and appear
to inosculate in a delicate point at the central
border of the tail. The abdominal articulations do
not pass over these lobes, but just below the last
joint, a little transverse furrow, in perfect specimens,
may be noticed. The largest specimen of this fragment
I have seen is exactly half an inch in length.</p>

<p>This fossil occurs in black shaly limestone, on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">- 88 -</span>
canal near Cahooes Falls, in the State of New York,
and at a number of other places in that State.</p>

<p>I have named this species in compliment to my
early friend, Professor Theodore Romeyn Beck, M. D.,
well known both at home and abroad, as the learned
author of the work on Medical Jurisprudence.
Some time after commencing this little Monograph,
I communicated my plan to Dr. Beck, and was surprised
and gratified to find that he was also engaged
with the same inquiries, and that he was then busy
in arranging and examining the unique collection of
trilobites belonging to the Albany Institute. Without
the smallest hesitation, he placed all his specimens
at my disposal, and has facilitated otherwise
my undertaking, by every means in his power.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Genus Nuttainia.</span> <i>Eaton.</i></h3>

<p>Professor A. Eaton, in his Geological Text Book,
has proposed the Genus Nuttainia, to include two
remarkable trilobites which could not properly be
arranged in any of the previously established genera.
The two fossils here grouped together, bear no generic
relation to each other. The first species which
he calls N. Concentrica, belongs to the genus Cryptolythus,
which was proposed before the appearance of
his work, and has therefore been noticed in another
place.</p>

<p>The genus Nuttainia is thus characterized by its
author: "Head in three lobes, the middle one most
prominent; the two lateral lobes sub-hemispherical,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">- 89 -</span>
or sub-quadrantal; the whole head bordered anteriorly
with a punctured fillet; body distinctly three lobed,
middle lobe sub-cylindric, and not so broad as the
side lobes."</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Nuttainia Sparsa.</span> <i>Eaton.</i> Cast No. 35.</h4>

<p>Fillet nearly straight in front of the middle lobe of
the head, punctures of the fillet scattered irregularly,
without any alternating ridges; head compressed, covered
with scattered punctures, having its side lobes
much smaller than the middle one; middle lobe with
straight sides, giving it somewhat the form of a parallelogram.</p>

<p>Found in third grauwacke,<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> or grit slate in Coeymans,

the head of one before me two and a half inches
broad, and one and a half long. The whole of the
animal must have been six or seven inches in length.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_47" href="#FNanchor_47" class="label">[47]</a> In a manuscript note, Professor Eaton states that the third
grauwacke, or grit slate of Coeymans, "<i>alternates</i> with the
underlaying cherty lime rock." This opinion some of our geological
friends, familiar with the formation at Coeymans, and with
the Professor's nomenclature of rocks, have called in question.</p>

</div>

<p>The above account is copied from the "Text
Book." Mr. Eaton was kind enough to lend me the
only specimen of this curious fossil remain, which
has yet been found; from which his description was
taken, and of which our cast is an exact copy. His
generic characters do not in our opinion at all apply
to this fragment. Nothing but the head of this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">- 90 -</span>
singular trilobite remains, and it is doubtful whether
what is said to be the punctured fillet, "nearly
straight in <i>front</i> of the middle lobe," be not the commencement
of the articulations of the abdomen. The
whole fragment looks very much like the head of
some large Asaph or Ogygia.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Genus Brongniatia.</span> <i>Eaton.</i></h3>

<p>Professor Eaton has proposed the name Brongniatia
(Brongniartia?) for a genus of trilobites, which
we think he has not defined with sufficient accuracy
to be of any practical use. The <i>Isotelus gigas</i> of
Dr. Dekay, which has been for a long time so well
established, is here ranked merely as a species under
the name of B. isotela. The relic which we described
before the Geological Text Book appeared as the
<i>Triarthrus Beckii</i>, forms the species B. carcinodea&mdash;and
the trilobite which is supposed to be the Asaphus
platycephalus of Stokes, is the only other species
mentioned. The A. platycephalus,<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> we know to be
identical with the I. gigas, and as the animal remain
described by Mr. Eaton is entirely different from Dr.
Dekay's fine species, we subjoin the account given in
the "Text Book."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_48" href="#FNanchor_48" class="label">[48]</a> For a figure and description of the Asaphus Platycephalus,
by Mr. Stokes, see Transactions of the Geological Society. Second
Series, vol. i.</p>

</div>

<p>Genus Brongniatia&mdash;Fore abdomen always, and
post abdomen in some cases, longitudinally divided
into three lobes, by regular series of undulations traversing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">- 91 -</span>
the joints, without grooves; articulations of
the side lobes being manifest continuations of those of
the middle lobe, and consequently, agreeing in number.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Brongniatia Platycephala.</span> <i>Eaton.</i></h4>

<p>Head and fore abdomen very broad and depressed,
the abdomen with ten joints curved forwards at the
undulations; post abdomen and tail with about fifteen
joints curved backwards at the undulations; the
three lobes of the tail more distinctly separated; divisions
between the joints of the abdomen double.</p>

<p>The representation of B. platycephala, figure 20,
plate 2, of the Geological Text Book, if it be accurately
drawn, is certainly of a trilobite never before
described. On the buckler, which is without eyes,
there is delineated a figure, not unlike some of the
leaves of the mulberry tree.</p>

<p>The tail is also very peculiar. In Silliman's Journal,
Volume 21st, page 136, Professor Eaton proposed
for this curious fossil the temporary name of
Ogygies latissimus. It is found, he observes, "in the
upper soft slaty variety of the rock which has been
so successfully used for the lias cement at Chitteningo,
&amp;c. Dr Smith, of Lockport, (N. Y.) sent me two
specimens, taken from a continuation of the Chitteningo
lias rock, immediately beneath the geodiferous
lime rock on which the cherty (cornitiferous) reposes."
The whole animal is six inches long, and
three broad.</p>

</div>


<p>Every one familiar with the history of the Trilobites,
is aware that a good deal of controversy has
existed among naturalists, respecting the precise
link in the grand chain of organized beings, these singular
fossil animals, should occupy. Professor Brongniart,
Dr. Dekay, Audo&uacute;in, and several other acute
observers, have placed them in the vicinity of the Limuli,
and other Entomostraca with numerous feet;
while P. A. Latreille and others, presuming that these
animals were destitute of locomotive organs, as no
vestige of them has ever been discovered, fix their
natural position in the neighbourhood of the Chitones;
or rather that they constituted the original
stock of the Articulata, being connected on the one
hand with these latter Mollusca, and on the other
with those first mentioned, and even with the Glomeris.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
It was our original intention to have closed
this Monograph with a short history of these theories&mdash;and
of the notion advanced by Latreille and others,
that the Trilobites have been annihilated by some
ancient revolution of our planet. All these matters,
we think, are now put to rest by the late discovery
of some living Trilobites in the southern seas, near
the Falkland Islands. In the cabinet of the Albany
Institute, we have examined some of these recent
animals, which have very nearly the size and general
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">- 93 -</span>
appearance of the Paradoxides Boltoni, as represented
on our frontispiece; the species cannot, however, belong
to that genus, as the buckler is furnished with eyes
very similar to those of the Calymene Bufo; its organs
of locomotion are short, numerous, and concealed under
the shell&mdash;but I do not feel at liberty to notice
the interesting animal more minutely. It will probably
be described and figured shortly, in a perfectly
full and satisfactory manner, by Dr. James Eights,
the enterprising discoverer, together with several
other new and remarkable genera and species belonging
to the Entomostraca.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
